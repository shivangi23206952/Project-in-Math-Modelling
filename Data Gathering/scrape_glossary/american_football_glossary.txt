Glossary of American Football Terms
========================================

Term: 2–4–5 defense
Definition: A type of nickel formation with two linemen (two defensive ends, DEs, or one DE and one defensive tackle, DT), four linebackers (two interior linebackers, ILBs, and two outer linebackers, OLBs), and five defensive backs (three cornerbacks, CBs, one free safety, FS, and one strong safety, SS). More common among teams with 3–4 base defenses than the 3–3–5, because all four starting linebackers remain on-field while the defensive linemen (the slowest players on the defense) come out. This maximizes versatility for the defense against three- and four-wide receiver, WR, offensive sets. a safety will often cover the fourth receiver, and a linebacker will cover the tight end orhalfback, leaving three to patrol the middle of the field. The 2–4–5 is most often used against thetwo-minute offense, when substituting players may be difficult.

----------------------------------------

Term: 3–3–5 defense
Definition: A variation of the nickel formation with three linemen (two defensive ends, DEs, and one defensive tackle, DT), three linebackers (two outer linebackers, OLBs and one middle linebacker, MLB), and five defensive backs (three cornerbacks, CBs, one free safety, FS and one strong safety, SS).

----------------------------------------

Term: 3–4 defense
Definition: Adefensiveformation with threelinemenand fourlinebackers. A professional derivative in the 1970s of the earlierOklahoma, 5–2 or 50 defense, which had five linemen and two linebackers. The 3–4 outside linebackers resemble "stand-up ends" in the older defense. It is sometimes pronouncedthirty-fourdefense. The 3–4 also was spun off from the Miami Dolphins' "52 defense" named for the jersey number worn by linebacker Bob Matheson, who was often used by the Dolphins as a fourth linebacker in passing situations.

----------------------------------------

Term: 4–3 defense
Definition: A defensive formation with four linemen and three linebackers. Several variations are employed. It was first used by coachTom Landry.[1][2]It is sometimes pronouncedforty-threedefense.

----------------------------------------

Term: 46 defense
Definition: Usually pronouncedforty-sixdefense, a formation of the 4–3 defense (four linemen and three linebackers) featuring several dramatic shifts of personnel. The line is heavily shifted toward the offense's weak side; both outside linebackers tend to play on the strong side outside of the defensive linemen; and three defensive backs (the two cornerbacks and the strong safety) crowd the line of scrimmage. The remaining safety, which is the free safety, stays in the backfield. It was invented byBuddy Ryanduring his tenure as defensive coordinator for theChicago Bearsand was popularized by theBearsduring theirSuper Bowl XXchampionship season.

----------------------------------------

Term: 5–2 defense
Definition: A once popular college defense with five defensive linemen and two linebackers. Also known as the "Oklahoma defense", it is structurally very similar to the 3–4. In the 50 defense, the team uses a nose tackle, two defensive tackles lined up over or slightly inside the offensive tackles, and two defensive ends lined up over or outside the tight end. It maximizes size along the line of scrimmage and is mostly used in high school against teams that run the ball a lot.

----------------------------------------

Term: 5–3 defense
Definition: A defense with five defensive linemen and three linebackers that appeared in the 1930s to combat improved passing attacks. The 5–3 defense and the 6–2 defense were considered the standard defensive formations of their time, with the 5–3 defense being regarded as the defense that was better against the pass. It was considered the best defense against theT formation. By the late 1950s, NFL defenses had switched to the 4–3 defense or the 5–2 defense as their base defense.

----------------------------------------

Term: 53-man roster
Definition: The most players a National Football League team can carry on its active roster at the start of the regular season. To reach the deadline, teams can cut players, add players to theirpractice squad, and, if injured, move players to thephysically unable to performlist.

----------------------------------------

Term: 6–2 defense
Definition: A defense with six defensive linemen and two linebackers that became popular in the 1930s due to improved passing attacks. The 6–2 defense and the 5–3 defense were considered the standard defensive formations of their time, with the 6–2 defense being regarded as the defense that was stronger against the run. As the T formation became more popular, the popularity of the 6–2 defense declined. By 1950, NFL defenses had switched to the 5–2 defense or the 5–3 defense as their base defense.

----------------------------------------

Term: 60-minute man
Definition: Someone who played on all three sides of the ball (offense, defense and special teams) throughout games.[3]

----------------------------------------

Term: 7–1–2–1 defense
Definition: A defensive formation with seven defensive linemen, one linebacker and three defensive backs. It was invented byHenry L. Williamsin 1903. By the mid-1930s, it was considered almost obsolete due to its vulnerability against the pass.

----------------------------------------

Term: 7–2–2 defense
Definition: A defensive formation with seven defensive linemen, two linebackers and two defensive backs. It is akin to an offensive two tight end set, or a goal line defense. It was invented byAmos Alonzo Staggin 1890 and used as the base defense byKnute RockneatNotre DameandMike DonahueatAuburn.

----------------------------------------

Term: n-possession game
Definition: A way of expressing the number of times a team, that is late in the game and trails its opponent, must secure possession of the ball and score without allowing the opponent to do the same in order to tie or overtake the opponent. Eight points (a touchdown and a two-point conversion) are the most points possible on any given possession; therefore, the number of possessions (n) necessary is equal to the point margin, divided by eight, rounded up to the nearest integer. For instance, a team down by 17 points would be in a three-possession game, needing to score at least two touchdowns with extra points and a field goal in at least three consecutive possessions without allowing the opposing team to score.

----------------------------------------

Term: A-11 offense
Definition: An offensive philosophy designed to appear as if all 11 players are eligible receivers. The offense exploits a loophole in the American football rulebook to technically make the formation a scrimmage kick, and the offensive line is spread across the field, all wearing numbers of eligible receivers, in an effort to confuse and deceive the defense. It was banned in 2009.

----------------------------------------

Term: Air Coryell
Definition: An offensive philosophy developed bySan Diego Chargershead coachDon Coryellwhich combines power running with mid-range and deep-pattern passing. TheAir Coryelloffense relies on getting receivers in motion and out into patterns that combine to stretch the field, thereby setting up defensive backs with route technique and allowing the quarterback to throw to a certain spot on time where the receiver can catch and turn upfield. During Coryell's tenure as head coach in San Diego, the Chargers led the NFL in passing yards seven times; first from 1978 to 1983,[4]and again in 1985.

----------------------------------------

----------------------------------------

Term: blitz
Definition: A defensive maneuver in which one or more linebackers or defensive backs, who normally remain behind the line of scrimmage, instead charge into the opponent's backfield. However, in the 3–4 defense, one linebacker typically rushes the passer with the three down linemen. This is not considered a blitz. If an additional linebacker is sent, bringing the total number of rushers to five, it is a blitz.

Also referred to as "quarters".

----------------------------------------

Term: counter
Definition: A running play in which the running back takes a step in the apparent direction of the play, only to get the handoff in the other direction.

In professional football a player must bedown by contactin order for play to stop; if they trip and fall without being touched by an opposing player they are free to get up and continue advancing the ball. Exceptions to this rule that result in play stopping include when the player carrying the ball is on the ground but not downed by contact (e.g., after tripping and falling) and is touched by a member of the opposing team while still on the ground; or when the player with the ballintentionallykneels down on the ground and stops advancing, e.g. aquarterback kneelortouchback.

Definition: A player who may legally touch a forward pass. On the offense, these are: the ends, backs, and (except in the NFL) one player in position to take a hand-to-hand snap; provided the player's jersey displays a number in the ranges allowed foreligible receivers. All players of the opposing team are eligible receivers, and once the ball is touched by a player of the opposing team (anywhere in American, or beyond the lines of scrimmage in Canadian, football), all players become eligible.

Aformationusually is described in terms of how the running backs line up (e.g.Iformation, which refers to the situation where the halfback is lined up about seven yards deep, and the fullback is lined up about five yards deep, both directly behind the quarterback) or how the wide receivers line up (e.g. "trips left", in which three wide receivers line up to the left of the linemen). Frequently, the formation will allude to both, such as with a "strongIslot right", in which thehalfbackis lined up seven yards deep behind the quarterback, the fullback is five yards deep behind the guard or tackle on the strong side, and both wide receivers are lined up on the right side of the offensive line. There are rules limiting what is legal in a formation. All five offensive linemen must be on the line of scrimmage (a small amount of leeway is given to tackles when lined up for pass protection). Also, there must be one receiver (usually one tight end and one wide receiver) lined up on the line on either side of the offensive linemen (it does not matter how close they are to the tackles, as long as they are on the line), with a total of no fewer than seven players on the line, five of which must be numbered between 50–79. A numbering exception exists if the offense is in a scrimmage kick formation which allows a player whose number is 1–49 or 80–99 to take the place of a lineman numbered 50–79. A receiver who is on the line may not go in motion.

----------------------------------------

Term: hut
Definition: A loud, repeated command byquarterbacksfor the other players to move ("Hut! Hut! Hut!"). The command replaced "hike!" in the second half of the 20th century, probably as a result of players returning from World War II military service adapting the drill language they were familiar with (as in "Atten-hut!", "Hut, two, three, four!").[15]

----------------------------------------

Term: I formation
Definition: A formation that includes a fullback and tailback lined up directly behind the quarterback while the quarterback is under center. By definition, the fullback lines up in front of the tailback. Several variations on this backfield formation exist, including the "offsetI" (in which the fullback lines up out of line to the left or right of the quarterback and halfback; also known as the "strong" or "weakI" depending on which direction the fullback is positioned), the "MarylandI" and "powerI" (in which an additional fullback is added to the backfield, either next to in the powerIor in front of in the MarylandI, the fullback).

A team is limited to calling one time-out on any given play (thus a team cannot repeatedly call all of its time-outs to prevent the game from continuing, or else adelay of gamepenalty or, more rarely, apalpably unfair actpenalty is imposed). It is thought that kickers tend to miss after being iced due to nervousness, so icing the kicker usually happens at the end of the game before a potential walk-off field goal. There is evidence that this tactic does not work.[16]

----------------------------------------

Term: illegal shift
Definition: On offense, only one person is allowed to be in pre-snap motion after the formation is set. A second person may go in motion after the first has come to a set position for one second. If these conditions are not met when sending players into motion, an illegal shift has occurred.

----------------------------------------

Term: intentional grounding
Definition: A type of illegal forward pass; thrown without an intended receiver and no chance of completion to any offensive player. This foul costs the offense a loss of down and 10 yards. If it occurs 10 yards behind the line of scrimmage, then the 10 yards are taken from the spot of the foul. If the foul is committed in the end zone the penalty is a safety. Intentional grounding is not called in the case of a spike after a hand to hand snap or, if under NFL or NCAA rules, the quarterback was outside the tackle box, (the area between each tackle) at the time of the pass, provided that the ball travels at least to the line of scrimmage. The tackle box is also known as the "pocket".

Term: kneel
Definition: A low-risk play in which the player in possession of the ball kneels down after receiving the snap, ending the play while keeping the clock running. This is done to end the game sooner without needing to run a riskier play. The player kneeling is said to "take a knee", and thus is "taking a knee" or "taking the knee". The quarterback of the team in the lead will oftentake a kneeon the first snap following thetwo-minute warning. Though long frowned upon – because it was not in accordance with the game's doctrine of "toughness" –taking a kneebecame an accepted way to run out the clock after the events of theMiracle at the Meadowlands. To this end, players will sometimes forgo scoring a touchdown and instead choose to run out the clock by kneeling short of reaching theend zone. This is usually done when the team with possession of the ball is in the lead, but not always.[21]

This is used in obvious blitzing situations to give the quarterback "maximum protection" in the pocket. Although good for holding off a blitz, it leaves the quarterback with only two receivers to throw to (and therefore only two players for the secondary to defend).[22][23]

----------------------------------------

(Coryell's offense was known instead asair Coryellthrough the 1980s.) The basis of Walsh's offense is to use short routes for receivers, delivering the ball on time and accurately and using short passes to replace runs.

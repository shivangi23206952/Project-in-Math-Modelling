The 2023 NFL draft's all-star events are underway, and many top prospects from the class headed out to Las Vegas for the East-West Shrine Bowl. Scouts from all 32 teams were in attendance at UNLV's Fertitta Football Complex to evaluate prospects from around the country. The coaching staffs from the Atlanta Falcons and New England Patriots were responsible for this year's 130 players, as practices took place from Saturday until Tuesday. The game is scheduled to be played at 8:30 p.m. ET on Thursday at Allegiant Stadium.
Throughout the week, several prospects helped their draft stock for 2023. Here are 10 players who consistently caught my eye, with a projected range of where they could be picked and why they stood out.

Title: How Eagles LB Haason Reddick went from Temple walk-on to NFL game-wrecker
URL: https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35564912/super-bowl-57-eagles-defense-haason-reddick

Article Content:
PHILADELPHIA -- The question had zero to do with premier edge rusher Haason Reddick, but Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts couldn't help turning the focus toward him.
In the wake of Philadelphia's 31-7 throttling of the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC title game Sunday, Hurts was asked about his own situational awareness in key moments and was in the midst of talking about football IQ and fundamentals when he pivoted.
"Haason Reddick, he's been a bad dude all year," Hurts said. "And that's what we need going forward."
It's hard to overstate the impact Reddick made against San Francisco. In the first half alone, he racked up two sacks, three pressures, a forced fumble and a fumble recovery. The 49ers' fate was sealed midway through the first quarter when Reddick came flying off the edge and generated a strip sack by swatting at the arm of Brock Purdy, who suffered an ulnar collateral ligament tear in his elbow on the play. It knocked Purdy out of the game and rendered him ineffective when he was forced to return following a Josh Johnson concussion.
"You don't ever want anybody to get dinged or get hurt, and I hope he's OK," said coach Nick Sirianni, "but it definitely did change the game."

• Jets' Javon Kinlaw gets support he needs 
• Patriots QB plan includes slow start for Maye
• Broncos QB competition a two-man battle
• Bengals optimistic about new backfield
Reddick finished the regular season with 16 sacks -- second to only his counterpart that day, Nick Bosa -- and was second in ESPN's pass rush win rate metric (28%) behind Micah Parsons (30%). His 18.5 sacks created led the league. Yet he was not named a finalist for defensive player of the year.
"Hey, s---," he said when asked about the snub. "I think my play said it today. That's all I need to say on that."
The respect Reddick, 28, has been hunting for not just all season but for his entire football life seemed to crash upon him as he stood in the center of the locker room postgame wearing NFC Champion gear and was engulfed by a swarm of reporters, drawing the biggest crowd in a room full of stars. Moments earlier, with green and white confetti falling from the sky and thousands of fans celebrating, the magnitude of the win began to sink in. Reddick, a local kid from Camden, New Jersey, had just helped punch his hometown team's ticket to the Super Bowl with an elite performance at Lincoln Financial Field -- the same stadium where he earned his football chops playing for Temple.
And now he was headed to the Super Bowl in Arizona, where his professional career began and his NFL dream nearly died.
"It's crazy, man. Just blessings on blessings on blessings," Reddick said. "I didn't see this coming, and now that it's here, I'm at a loss for words."
MOST NFL SUCCESS stories start with tales of dominating on the football field as kids, demonstrating ability that had coaches convinced big things were on the horizon.
Reddick's is not one of those stories.
When Reddick arrived at Haddon Heights High School, he was "just another skinny kid who's got some talent and athletic ability," according to the school's athletic trainer, Tim O'Donnell, adding that Reddick "didn't stand out" initially.
Reddick's junior and senior seasons were derailed by injuries. He was sidelined for his entire junior year with a growth plate fracture in his leg and missed the bulk of his senior year with a meniscus tear in his knee. Prospects of playing college ball looked bleak.
But Reddick's father, Raymond Matthew, was tight with a new member of Temple's coaching staff, Francis Brown, and reached out.
"They had to beg and basically say, 'Hey, can you make a spot for this kid?'" Haddon Heights coach Chris Lina said.
Reddick made the team as a walk-on and started his career as a defensive back before transitioning to edge rusher as he put on weight. Making inroads as a non-scholarship athlete proved challenging under Temple's head coach Steve Addazio. Addazio told Reddick after his freshman season that he wouldn't have a spot on the team moving forward, several people close to Reddick said.
But when Addazio left to become head coach at Boston College and Matt Rhule took over at Temple, Reddick was back on the team.
"Changed his life," Lina said.
Reddick went on to compile 17.5 sacks and 47 tackles for loss over four seasons at Temple. A strong senior year led to him being selected 13th overall by the Arizona Cardinals in the 2017 NFL draft.
REDDICK FLOURISHED IN college as an outside rusher but was asked to play inside linebacker his first few seasons with the Cardinals. By the time the 2020 season rolled around, he was mentally exhausted.
All that's required of the inside linebacker position -- reading keys, watching for pulling guards, intense focus on alignment -- did not allow Reddick to play the kind of fast, instinctual style of football he naturally excelled at.
"I remember having a conversation with my dad before I was making the decision whether I wanted to go back to the edge or not," Reddick said in September. "I remember telling him I feel like if I don't do this, I feel like if I don't ask them to put me back, after this it's either no more football, no more NFL for me or I'll be just a special teamer."
Matthew's advice was to "leave all the cards on the table."
Entering the final year of his rookie contract, Reddick approached Davis and then-defensive coordinator Vance Joseph about moving back outside. With all parties having nothing to lose, the position change was made. A Chandler Jones injury opened a window of opportunity and Reddick cashed in, racking up 12.5 sacks in 2020.
Still, Arizona didn't re-sign him.
"It was very disappointing that we didn't find a way to keep him," Arizona linebackers coach Billy Davis said. "As a coaching staff, we thought the world of him as a worker, as a teammate. I don't have a knock on Haason. I wish we still had him."

The Carolina Panthers inked Reddick to a one-year, $8 million deal that offseason and Reddick generated 11 sacks, but again found himself as a free agent at season's end.
The Eagles pounced, inking him to a three-year, $45 million deal in March, in hopes he'd be the missing piece to defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon's group -- and he has been.
Reddick has 19.5 sacks in 19 games, including the playoffs. Adding some weight over the offseason -- he's officially listed at 6-foot-1, 240 pounds -- added another dimension to his game, allowing him to "move guys out of my way at my will, whenever I wanted to."
Still, Reddick has rarely been mentioned among the top guys at his position. Those close to him surmise it's a product of initially being an inside linebacker, switching teams multiple times and playing in smaller markets prior to Philly.
"I'm not crying or begging for respect but it's got to be there," Reddick said following a Dec. 11 win over the New York Giants, when he reached double-digit sacks for a third straight season. "Three different teams, three different schemes, three different head coaches, three different [defensive coordinators]. What does that tell you?"
After the Defensive Player of the Year finalists were released, omitting him, Reddick tweeted: "At some point, this s--- gotta stop."
SIGNING WITH PHILADELPHIA was influenced by his desire to be closer to family. He wanted to come home, and there have been plenty of perks.
In October, he visited his old high school to deliver an inspirational message to the current players.
"I can tell the kids all the time about hard work and dedication and it doesn't matter. He came in and said the same stuff to the guys, but it was great coming from a guy wearing an Eagles shirt who sat in the same cafeteria you sat in," Lina said.
"Our kids are like, 'I'm bigger than him.' And I'm like, 'Yeah, he's way better than you are," Lina said with a laugh. "That guy is not blessed with being huge in size but he's got a drive in him that most people cannot find."
High crime rates can make Camden a dangerous place to grow up. To help keep Reddick out of harm's way when he was coming up, Matthew had him focus on football and working out.
"We would run a mile to the gym, would train and would walk back a mile," Matthew said. "It was a lot of conversation, just making sure he's seeing every scope of life. He was mature at an early age."
The tradition continues during the offseason, though they no longer run to the local training facility.
"The mile trip, we don't have to do that no more. That was a financial reason," he said with a laugh. "We didn't have it. Everything's changed now."
Reddick made his first Pro Bowl this season and was named second-team All-Pro. He's playing a lead role for one of the two best teams in the land, and will be playing in Super Bowl LVII at State Farm Stadium, where his career nearly fizzled out and was resurrected.
"I don't think the story could have been written any better," Reddick said.
Matthew was in attendance for the NFC Championship Game and got goosebumps thinking about how things have played out for his son.
"Everything is just full circle right now," Matthew said. "It just makes us a believer in everything. Hard work pays off. It does. The good guy finally won."

Title: Sean Payton hire: Why Broncos and Saints made the deal and what to expect?
URL: https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35565338/what-expect-sean-payton-deal-saints-broncos

Article Content:
After making the biggest splash move last offseason by trading two first- and two second-round picks for Russell Wilson, the Denver Broncos were back at it Tuesday with another blockbuster trade.
The Broncos agreed to compensation with the New Orleans Saints in return for Super Bowl-winning head coach Sean Payton, sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter. Payton went 152-89 in 15 seasons as Saints head coach, including a win over the Indianapolis Colts in Super Bowl XLIV. The Saints will receive the Broncos' 2023 first-round pick (No. 29 overall) and their 2024 second-round pick for Payton and the Saints' 2024 third-round selection, sources said.
Denver will hope for better results from this move after Wilson struggled for most of the season. The Broncos finished last in the league, averaging 16.9 points per game, which resulted in first-year coach Nathaniel Hackett being fired after a 4-11 start.
ESPN Broncos reporter Jeff Legwold, Saints reporter Katherine Terrell and draft analyst Matt Miller break down the deal from all sides.
Before the Payton trade Tuesday, three coaches had been traded for packages that included a first-rounder:
• Tracking NFL coach openings, hires »
• Debating head-coaching hires »
• Match candidates to an open job »
In 1997, Bill Parcells was traded from New England Patriots to New York Jets for four picks (1997 3rd, 1997 4th, 1998 2nd, 1999 1st). In 2000, Bill Belichick was traded from the Jets to the Patriots for three draft picks (2000 1st, 2001 4th, 2001 7th). The Patriots got two picks (2001 5th, 2002 7th) back from the Jets. In 2002, Jon Gruden was traded from the Raiders to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for four picks (2002 1st, 2002 2nd, 2003 1st, 2004 2nd) and $8 million.
The Baltimore Colts also ended up getting a first-round pick from the Miami Dolphins for Don Shula. The NFL ruled Miami violated tampering rules in its recruitment of the coach and made them surrender the pick. -- ESPN Stats & Analysis
Payton loves a challenge and is fond of saying "crisis or carnival," referring to how a team will respond to the weekly tests that come up during the season. Wilson will be a big part of that challenge. Payton has offered up his plan to "fix" Wilson in public interviews this year. Not only does Payton get a chance to try to return a veteran quarterback to his previous winning form, but he also inherits a unit that finished seventh in total defense. It's also Payton's chance to show that he can win without future Hall-of-Fame quarterback Drew Brees, who was with him for 15 seasons in New Orleans. -- Terrell
The fact the Saints were willing to take the No. 29 overall pick was likely a key piece of the deal. General manager George Paton acquired the pick from the Dolphins (the Dolphins originally got it from the San Francisco 49ers) in exchange for Bradley Chubb in November. The Broncos did not have the draft capital of some other teams in the pursuit of Payton because they surrendered five picks, including first- and second-round rounders in 2022 and 2023, as part of the Wilson trade. They had hoped to keep their 2024 first-rounder and not surrender more than one first-rounder in any potential deal for Payton. The willingness of the Saints to agree to a deal that included that 29th pick to go with a second-rounder in 2024 (they don't have a second-rounder this year) means the Broncos won't pick until the third round this year, but it was a price they were willing to pay to get the kind of résumé Payton brings. -- Legwold
The Saints knew from the day Payton stepped away that he could be back on the sidelines by 2023 -- whether it was with them or not. Saints general manager Mickey Loomis didn't want to prevent Payton from returning, but he also wanted adequate compensation. That compensation would've dropped drastically if Payton didn't find a team until 2024, which would've been the final year of his Saints deal. The Saints now get a chance to get back into Day 1 of the draft and won't walk away empty-handed after losing their coach unexpectedly last year. Their future at quarterback is murky enough that Saints defensive end Cameron Jordan was tweeting his desire for the Saints to draft one minutes after the Payton news broke. The first-round pick could certainly help them get back into the mix - including giving them more draft capital if they wanted to try to trade up to draft a quarterback. -- Terrell

• Jets' Javon Kinlaw gets support he needs 
• Patriots QB plan includes slow start for Maye
• Broncos QB competition a two-man battle
• Bengals optimistic about new backfield
Wilson called Payton "one of the world's best" after the Broncos' win over the Los Angeles Chargers in the season finale and said "the wizardry you would have on the field was magnificent" with Payton's teams. So, it's safe to say he'll be on board with this move. After a career-low 16 touchdown passes in a season when his team finished with the worst record (5-12) of any campaign of his career, Wilson will be ready to turn the page. When Broncos owner and CEO Greg Penner said he wanted the new coach to bring a "culture of accountability," Penner meant everybody, including Wilson, was going to have to be better in 2023. And Payton will be tasked with making that happen. -- Legwold
The Saints' biggest need by far is at quarterback. Andy Dalton is scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent, and while Jameis Winston has a year left on the two-year contract he signed in 2022, there's no guarantee that he will return to New Orleans. But at pick No. 29, I don't have a late first-round grade on any quarterback in this class. They could pivot to look for upgrades on the defensive line. Keion White (Georgia Tech), Derick Hall (Auburn) and Tuli Tuipulotu (USC) could all be targets for New Orleans, which also owns the No. 40 overall pick early in Round 2. -- Miller
Even as Penner cited the mistakes made this past season, including all of the things that led to Hackett's firing, he has said Paton would have a significant role in the construction of the roster. Paton was also part of the group Penner had working on the coaching search. Payton has conveyed to the Broncos during the interview process that he is comfortable working with Paton. Both will answer to Penner, so he may have to settle an argument or two along the way, as the Broncos are poised to have what Penner had called a "traditional" setup with the head coach and general manager each answering to the owner. -- Legwold

Title: NFL teams in line to see 'a better version of Hendon Hooker'
URL: https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/35565187/nfl-teams-line-see-better-version-hendon-hooker

Article Content:
MOBILE, Ala. -- Former Tennessee star quarterback Hendon Hooker is on track to be healthy in time for his opening NFL training camp this summer, he told ESPN on Tuesday.
At the Senior Bowl, Hooker flashed the familiar halogen grin that accompanied his rise to stardom at Tennessee the past two seasons. He told ESPN he has begun working out after Dr. Neal S. ElAttrache repaired the torn ACL in his left knee on Dec. 13.
"It will be a better version of Hendon Hooker, the best we've seen yet," he said when asked what he'll look like upon his return.
Hooker won't participate in the Senior Bowl game on Saturday, but he accepted an invitation here to meet with NFL teams and further familiar himself with NFL offenses. He's perhaps the most intriguing player here this week, as he surged into becoming a top Heisman Trophy candidate and a potential high-round draft pick with his dominant play for the Vols this season. That searing streak to stardom ended suddenly with a torn ACL on Nov. 20 against South Carolina.
"There were a lot of emotions, missing the game and missing being around my teammates," he said. "There's been a lot of jokes and laughter and also going back and watching tape and tearing up."
Hooker threw for 58 touchdowns and five interceptions the past two seasons at Tennessee and led the Vols to a No. 2 ranking in the Associated Press poll, the highest they've been ranked since 2001. Hooker said that he has met with close to 20 teams, joking that there's many to count. He said he's had a few "double meetings" with teams but declined to name the teams. He let them know that he'll be ready for camp this summer and is planning to be ready for full contact by the start of the preseason.
Hooker will not run at Tennessee's Pro Day on March 30, but he plans to warm up and "stride it out" to show how well he's moving.
"I feel great," Hooker said. "I'm moving around. I'm excited to get back to my regular self. My cerebral side has elevated to a whole other level. I'm continuing to build that and my leadership skills and communication skills. I'll have that chip on my shoulder whenever I get back."
Hooker has been working out and rehabbing in California. He said after the surgery, there was an adjustment process of learning to walk on crutches, shower and sleep sitting up because of the injury.
He made a point to thank his sister, Nile, for moving out to California with him and help him navigate his comeback. His on-field quarterback training has been done by Steve Calhoun and Jordan Palmer, as he said that throwing while sitting allows him to both experiment with different arm angles and simulate deep balls. He's working out with fellow college quarterbacks Max Duggan (TCU), Clayton Tune (Houston), Will Levis (Kentucky) and Dorian Thompson-Robinson (UCLA).
"I'm doing really well, putting 100 percent weight on it," Hooker said. "I'm able to do exercises without my brace. I'll throw sitting down some. Nothing too crazy on my knee where I'm twisting and turning on it, just taking it slow and all the precautions."
Hooker said that while out in California in December, he would wake up at 4 a.m. for the Vols' 7 a.m. Zoom meetings at the Orange Bowl. He said he wanted to understand the game plan to help out Joe Milton, the Tennessee backup, and "be transparent" when they were chatting about the game.
When teams have asked Hooker what kind of player they are getting, he has responded this way: "I want to be smart and learn and want to come in and be extremely competitive. A dynamic guy who is hungry for betterment of himself on and off the field. A dynamic guy in the pocket and a good deep-ball thrower and an accurate thrower. And an athletic player. A competitor."

Title: NFL
URL: https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35564183/sources-texans-hire-49ers-dc-demeco-ryans-head-coach

Article Content:
HOUSTON -- The Texans have hired San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator DeMeco Ryans as their new head coach, the team announced Tuesday.
The deal is for six years, sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter.
Ryans will be officially introduced as the franchise's sixth full-time coach on Thursday. The Texans, meanwhile, become the first team in NFL history to have hired three consecutive Black coaches.
Ryans had his first interview with the Texans on Jan. 20 and met again with the franchise on Tuesday. Other NFL teams that had requested permission to talk with Ryans about head-coaching vacancies were the Broncos, Panthers and Colts.
"For so many reasons, DeMeco is everything we are looking for in a leader and coach for our organization," Texans owner Cal McNair said in a statement. "He has a proven track record for developing high-quality players and constantly innovated his defensive scheme over the last six seasons in San Francisco.
"We started this process with the goal of finding someone our fans and city can be proud of and we've done just that. While we received a lot of incredible feedback and support for DeMeco from different people, it was our discussions with him and his vision for our football team that made him the right coach to lead us as we continue to evolve as an organization."
Ryans' hiring ends a three-week search since the Texans fired Lovie Smith on Jan. 8. Ryans, a former Texans standout linebacker, will be the fourth coach in Houston in four years after Smith and David Culley were each fired after one season.
Former coach and general manager Bill O'Brien was fired after starting the 2020 season 0-4. O'Brien led the Texans for six full seasons before that, and his 52-48 record (.520) leaves him as the only Texans coach over .500.
The franchise hired Nick Caserio as GM in 2021. Caserio hired Culley (4-13) in 2021 and promoted Smith (3-13-1) from defensive coordinator in 2022.
Now Caserio has hired Ryans, who took over the 49ers' defensive unit in 2021.
"DeMeco is a proven coach with a track record of success who has an innate ability to lead people," Caserio said in a statement. "... We are working to build a sustainable program that has long-term success and DeMeco is the coach we feel is the best fit to help us achieve our goals. We know how important it is to get results now and we have a lot of work to do, but I'm excited to partner with DeMeco to build our football team together."
With DeMeco Ryans serving as coordinator, the San Francisco 49ers' defense ranked at the top or near the top of multiple categories this season.
In his first season, the 49ers allowed the third-fewest yards per game (310), and in 2022, San Francisco allowed the fewest points (16.8) and yards (300.6) per game. Ryans' unit also tied for the second-most takeaways (30).
Ryans' defense helped lift the 49ers to a 13-4 record in the regular season before they fell to the Philadelphia Eagles 31-7 in the NFC Championship Game as the No. 2 seed.
Before becoming a coach, Ryans had a 10-year career with the Texans and Eagles. He was a second-round pick out of Alabama by the Texans in 2006 and was named Defensive Rookie of the Year after finishing second in league tackles (156). His 126 solo tackles were second most for a rookie in NFL history.
The following season, Ryans earned second-team All-Pro and Pro Bowl honors. The two-time Pro Bowler played for the Texans for six seasons and is currently the franchise's all-time leader in tackles (479).
"Being the head coach of the Houston Texans is my dream job and my family is thrilled to be back in H-Town," Ryans said in a statement. "I have been around the game of football my entire life and I've always had a natural ability to lead others. I know what it takes to win and be successful in this league as both a player and coach.
"We're going to build a program filled with players who have a special work ethic and relentless mindset. I understand the responsibility I have to this organization and to the fans of Houston to build a winner and I can't wait to get to work."
Ryans, 38, has spent the past six years coaching; his first role was a defensive quality control coach for the 49ers in 2017 under coach Kyle Shanahan. In 2018, he became the inside linebackers coach, and was elevated to defensive coordinator when Robert Saleh left to become the New York Jets' head coach in 2021.
"I'd like to first thank the San Francisco 49ers, Kyle Shanahan and John Lynch for six incredible seasons where I grew as a coach and a man," Ryans said. "I couldn't be prouder of what we accomplished together, and I will always cherish the relationships I built there."
One of the biggest tasks for Ryans will be fixing the league's worst rush defense, which allowed 170.2 yards per game. No team has allowed over 170 rushing yards since the 0-16 Lions (172.1) in 2008. The Texans also have finished 27th in points allowed per game three seasons in a row.
The pass defense was a bright spot for a team that allowed the third-most total yards per game (379.5). The Texans finished 10th in the league in passing yards allowed per game (209.3) and had more interceptions (16) than touchdowns allowed (15).
The team's 16 interceptions were tied for fourth, and the 15 touchdowns allowed were tied for the fewest.
Beyond fixing the defense, Ryans must fix the Texans' offensive struggles and find an answer at quarterback.
The unit averaged 17 points (30th), and the Texans' 19 interceptions were second most. Opening-day starting quarterback Davis Mills had 15 of those in 15 games and was tied for the league high, and Kyle Allen, who started when Mills was benched, threw the other four in two games.
The Texans have two first-round draft picks (No. 2 and No. 12 overall) in the 2023 NFL draft and could use one of those on a quarterback. They also could address the position via trade or free agency. The NFL informed teams on Monday that the salary cap will increase to $224.8 million for the 2023 league year. The Texans are estimated to have about $40 million in cap space.

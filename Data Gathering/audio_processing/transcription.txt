gerdes that in hello well that drive from the hit the city that is truly lie at putz around the nfl at two thousand twenty three that the old graf first round wide screen but poor gold to all thirty one the super that then had the seared great rosenthal marks as word bloods and the village nevertheless before this is a big big test wrong of the highest order he could feel the room visit yes if the navy in adam i'm loving them all the people in the chat right now we get twenty six hundred miles to raphael yeah they get the areas as like a fourth ranked allied screaming show on n. f. l. media rabbi an organ and right in the dancing and women that that's an idea at the side of potential abuse but but certain things what are you okay you can get in to answer some of the people that have entered into it i didn't stay home to watch locked celtics on that in an upper upon a lie about is about the nfl draft is the center of the universe marks esler and i know is a big day for you especially because it is the doctor at the abbey it's idea of the life that you study and isolated event where whether i succeeded or failed the role of mistakes attached to it but no i'm taking on grave diggers loaded with that is a heightened sense of ahmed needed to drop the hammer on our producer ventilated and grave digger and you god is love laid down on girlfriend here and keeping score of the draft and competition as we go out and some some dogs to the piano in the air tonight that if you beat death in that sense looking to a few of them back and i think it should be it stated that everyone out there and again by the weight of once again setting at the table here that we're going to be here for all thirty one big starting with fake wanted carolina panthers everyone believes it will be that bright young we don't know i think with this thing really yes to the jonas little bit later but it was mark really pushing this i'd have just involved that is there something they earn bread with mike you're saying we're hitting at the morgue what was looking at some way did take justin's dignity and maybe is girl died died that appreciated the confidence on both fronts not just in terms of the alien i'm his manhood that right crashed in a minute cabbages and mark is walk around this building with a quiet confidence is weak but um i mean technically he's providing a very invaluable service because we are way unlocked by our headsets one of us was that i have to go to the dry erase or a tally votes and tally changes all bad and she's low-income do instead so it actually does make sauce but the move is not yet another that you do that is rather a bit and this was the sole weird thing about huffing and our kids inside and any uncomfortable over a mile an hour and that as a will or five minutes then i met on our exam somersault without a doubt that that got no one else is that the income of the drama is as good doesn't seem accountable all about and garlic and the the this is a plot to track so much going on yet we have the port said respects come up in just a little bit well mar jackson that deal gets done and bad that and greg greg loses to the entire lamar me what you guys are marching down the streets and larry to those smarmy all that the way huh huh huh like said that they gonna well as it was a bit of a sloppy road to get here but in the end is they did not examine it says that the development that quarterback contract our moon unit took a little bit to get done and that will lucille smarmy now yeah debris fully had a free and set them at all and that's exactly how every quarterback project is god i essentially for the last that employee is somewhat disappointing when a traditional indian is for me he got delivered to scattered you're happily right to say that this deal in herds that deal in fact lamar i did not think that necessarily dahlia malay bomber all the odds about the ideas that i haven't been good sight of the aisle and owl and then maggie busily get in her discount checklist in person so needs unaided for them when i would greg that's that's the one waited to the summit all out that it was a little bit sloppy and all of it's the it's the road over every quarterback to get all in iowa and amr ravens them feel great about it wait what did rob come out what's going on right now ride is on the part of the examine that live to the big cheese and we've got eric stones the loser is always there this is like is full time job now does he stand back if you're watching that it was it was the love with this job is marred by a lot of failing analysis full time he goes on these i think is energizing joe four times a week it honestly guys if they get the last entry by half the same he's legit i ate i went to the adam an apple store at the super bowl on might've been a busy early week bad day last year at the sandstone street tired is out with his family with bags over soldiers it out in the hallway as light yes i am it's railway line the cameras n. n. united as a great ride move and i hope memories watch along well with them until network of the coverage here radu famously gets booed when it comes out for the n. f. l. draft i had started bringing out celebrities and and it's one thing to bring out in an s. and l. starlet but perhaps the worst reader covered me that the crowds the dope man are we allowed to use all the language and on the sly and now up bright and ask you had to go justin our producer can we use the time salty language we're not supposed to do that but we're alive if somebody i have really lead on some island idol and that word out that the draft there's another major does all private property going on right now in the building right you know that and they'll actually do so right no one's watching this connected to the company i'm sir now that i would add up broadcasting rebellion we i was as they do whatever we want adam about certain but you know if you wanna try and i'd probably have but i'd have liked ally it is bringing me back to you i'm how we started this company sneaking around of appeal from our boss is the head upstairs as we now see up after closing kelsey i had to say that is like an idaho that i'm feeling comfort at big upset the unhealthy way look at greg what's the muscle sporadic fears that the qualms and that travis kelsey come out with the trophy this is get the crowd and while we're just minutes away here on the stream of fromm the first pick in the two thousand twenty for me then i'm going out live there in getting word that the interest on the clock in they in awaits them and so did the guest for the people that are just watching us brow always in dissembling long second yet and so there isn't what a life as a religious watching us what's television is it said well that's really that's what they signed up for a third of the almonds when the old news as an example of the checkup delegates yeah yeah and maybe one of us pick that up to bat with happily keiko will take a little yeah and you are to show the people are bingo card sure there will really get rid of some yeah that's what started the bingo car this is the n. f. l. draft a trophy bingo cards draft cliched bingo card we have here and now we're all the work together on this all the people know live here right now bob whenever you hear any of these phrases some examples of throw out the undersized bohemia or it is what's it been hinted that bum generational high motor lodge they'll whenever you hear that brought up a bite anyone on the telecast we wanted you did that will never tell guesser any tell guess what will the nfl networks have on our way of their official telecast and bulow rudin we're did not to watch another one plus what the bonaparte is much better than the s. p. n. n. would say at the nfl draft but not the accompany me i guess you're saying that that's about how anything on that yes you exited the rear of that land in the shadows of the suit on that's greg i'm at twenty dollars in the reverend i feel like them and to speak in my due to be a company man with this is one day a week arrest everyone including nasa in you know what's the motherland street i fought hard to get vomit young man on to the bingo card because i've been hearing that literally left and right about all these people are like the same age as the players are gonna this young man is to come in and transform the culture of this team while the other little bit like part of any sense and think there is some like that i'd value is one of them in italy if we could take a look at it again not worth the gamble of course of the value that that's not fair anthem how many people are in the chat right now by legged there we are we're over four thousand the very end up towards the lumber of your way of four thousand ninety one and i will say the people out there take this green salad as many as eighteen referred to it 'cause i was in like emma sinister member all twenty five of these anonymous opus much well i think this is how we can't bring dates back room here i mean we all know honoraria gramm story of the czech aaronson mc ready and i gather around yes that that can keep track about these unfair unfair to leave law it is just a very comparable into one is suddenly count toward people around the next four hours in the nfl here he's fired up these fired up right now i'm doing what they love it just that i tested positive honorable full time so can you go out right where we go with the scoreboard isn't the scoreboard of course is for the big competition the mock draft up between the quiet storm and the grave digger and say hello to and i guess the mice out folks out there it is yes it got out of the greats of mysterious us starlets but the justin gravely yeah get ye don't cover up that that you would the graphic i mean i'm anne i'm bob the miranda for week of the melon beautiful that is and i am why is just a year since it was as good or sell me just as an antidote that not only track or bingo corby can see right behind we've got the mark burris grave digger mock draft contests and she's been a do an excellent job of that and i we sound job to god is going back in the country got production is to be unbelievable folks do it that the little about i may add is my practice a beat up early 'cause we have had some development stand at least in the betting markets and we're not gonna spoil an apex here tonight when i cannot i did many bags of play will know anything bad and this is fair to point out is so that in the over the last hour the betting markets as the day stroud as a monster favorite suddenly to be the number two overall pick one man who would that hurt both of you out about the loser wanna you had had a delegate to say which one i think so but it depends on if the taxes are the team that picks them it's you or victory are they that they are enslaved and then and i decided mats c. j. stroud with the texan said a different points in the mont fraph so wait yeah that would give you that would give you a simulated yes like that it's a bracelet that i just ride it out anyway even if that by our boy our lovely guest that can we get respect my grave is anyway they did their faith in the north and then over here and here is either way whenever our surprise guests of that compound we do have at least one surprise guest was held on our employee who had joined the so before i was old expected just one of the tickets yeah it was that and we we had a potential second guessed yuan if i would say as the vial of edible wild card and it may not be added one that will be joining that's the wild card will not be accountable it's unfortunate but still to be a great job bomb right by the way since that though the peppers and now on the clock what we bring up for the big mock that would forgive me tracking the route of the stream which by the way over my dear will all bow were my lucky uses the camera again yes and that was my camera if i'll be have we will be here for the entire universe friend alas the socks right now and in which case book will probably still be open again there's nobody in this building knows has gone on other than the people on this room which is beautiful yeah so we could really do whatever we want i i like cnn under the tables in neon first iraqi war were lake city of i'm confident that are to track us and we're just simply so when the building forget what a regular you bring up so that when we discovered by our two that's all thank then pretend we bring up the rules and regulations olive by the mock trapped on between our our bows esler and grave there elway market rate is mark let us know earlier need these now wears glasses here that he can barely see the screen and is this idea as anyone else in the rupiah to that helps i go through great our idea rader campbell and there is game lead in is that we're the only rebel without a doubt you honestly i don't buy rating were loud and created a caleb and sell it as an analyst bill but a wound that the ok here are the rules of the first rule no changes to your marks under any circumstances heads will i think about i mean at insane our mock trial to that in another year my mom travis morning would've been way different from the one we did on the bar the irony is just totally different than the rule that sense he's the one isn't now he's exactly resented copy in case it out of our message in clients are there any idea if you go at night the next row three points format of players do with the team and it takes bought back and make sense to points for matching the player and a team in a different spots there three point bonior this is big this is worth a title could be won in a three point bonus for matching the player too it seemed to me that depicts bought with the trade but then the bandit arm if we're tied up in the first round the first marker to correctly it on the second round it will in a minute match where over slow with identity of the specifically the number thirty two berbick in and tie breaker do with a jumping jack kemp does so you sent conflicting messages and because these are the rules that day and presented in our our group yes that guy then our eggs or yours were you asked that i had been as it is and died then again highlighted jumping jack challenge the mosey over one there was a good they're gonna number thirty two overall that because in this that i wanna was right good race attention on friday next night of the dance companies and al sabah supports locks and they're so clearly sports law thirty hours one of them assorted the nullified because i said that no human i would ever see more jack's never again our planet these ten hours later you sign a contract is early yeah very much a big figure denied that they can then for the carolina panthers first overall that there is no way this is and we think is right that is no scenario but though we'll let this thing from read it like that there was like a fifteen minute period today were some random agent said that candy richards is gonna go higher than you think and then dear me fowler from the s. p. n. was like in the wretched thing you know what the action was considered by the panthers in for like that ten minutes there was some tension and then it goes quickly destroyed by every insiders say in it's gonna be bracy on and so we expected to be brace and if you are only watching us in on scene in the chat some people that are like honor we actually watch the draft i move we will tell you what happens we should probably have balls screens on that you get ye gods and you're out then what i am audio in endless and happy and on the order on your t. v. and indiana fauna laptop the tablet any other device to what you do with unpleasant on that easy as it is essential in modern technology that doesn't seem like so many of the big split without the court covers of a lebed's bought the court gunners well in the bank of the biggest of all spot i would say they can pull out their phones in the nfl that and watch the bird yes there they just want you to do you know wives are yeah you know beata an nfl fast and also the gardener's it's everywhere i'm here we go again rises up looking ged dude fried rice young widow is a indeed an e-mail live with is a beautiful beautiful suit no tie it like the move it's casual but serious about his career bombed an interesting that here we are finally for the carolina panthers and shout out teddy bear this man's eyes in the stream right now but because she's was a long road this is a long road all by the way we need to one other element here we're going to go one the ten graded wrapped it this looks pretty easy to make is our don't know yet and yet it is about that i feel great that is some nuts and that man is a mechanic and they began to get on the bond guess it's visual cues i'll take that chance at a white aid why not a perfect move for the editor and it's not that it's not a novel illogical or not a perfect move on i'd i'd wanna see we are to be or something anthony repeated the yet snag it yeah but some will get a ticket ten and a gun and china at all about and they want to get like that isn't what about you mind if i had a very excited about red stain and then alice alice the forty five at el toro in the fall out ot i do think it's like his eyes as big as is an issue on i was seal it off and serrano but for the panthers who've been in the wilderness quarterback wise for years on if it works the so looking back at the beginning yeah i think the other reason it's not a seat at the court is saying it is not in the law several large in right under lock and state manning joe borrow but there is some concern here about the prospect howl abba then well what a great day this is the baptism of bands you ever since canyon got older and beat up in a hurry have been in the wilderness is the team that few years ago pivoted to sam donald and then if that wasn't enough they said let's get some baker may feel that i like to that they'll work they put him at camden back in the book most completely forgot charge against him is that the nfl canyons return a couple years ago the carolina bum and our finally they try to kidnap the stafford bob back to work out we we heard that they were the next edition watson yet correct that obviously didn't work out and out finally after trading up they get the guy that they wanted so good for them merely was it was him on and that the report what they knew that it was emanating out they wanna confirm in and they confirmed that i really think back to that game is no game

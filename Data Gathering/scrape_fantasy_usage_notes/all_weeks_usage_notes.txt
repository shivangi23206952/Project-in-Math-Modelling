DET @ KC

Offensive SnapsLions: 70Chiefs: 65Jahmyr Gibbs(19 snaps, 27%) played well behind David 
                Montgomery but he certainly looked like the best running back 
                on the field. Montgomery (55 snaps, 78.6%) isn’t going away 
                but if Gibbs can carve out even a 50-50 split, he’s going 
                to be a fantasy force.Those who drafted rookie TESam LaPortashould be feeling 
                good. He played on 82.9 % of the snaps and saw a 15.6% target 
                share. He’ll be in the low-end TE1 conversation on a weekly 
                basis.Josh Reynoldswas the clear No.2 wideout for Lions on 
                Thursday night, playing 70% of the snaps with a 21% target share.The Chiefs had 7 WRs active for this game and used all of 
                  them. Nobody can be counted on here includingKadarius 
                  Toney(24.6% snap share) who had a severe case of the dropsies. 
                  Toney created the most separation of any Chiefs receiver which 
                  might explainSkyy 
                  Moore’s poor target share (8.1%) while playing a healthy 
                  69.2% of the snaps.Marquez 
                  Valdes-Scantling(63.1%) was in his usual role and nobody 
                  else played more than 35% of the snaps.The Chiefs backfield turned into a three-headed committee 
                which could be explained byIsiah Pacheco(47.7% snaps) missing 
                a good portion of camp with a shoulder injury.Clyde Edwards-Helaire(21.5%) got the ceremonially start but was third in snap share 
                behind Pacheco and McKinnon (30.8%).TENoah Graywas on the field for 87.7% of the snaps 
                whileTravis Kelcesat out with a knee injury.HOU @ BALOffensive SnapsTexans: 77Ravens: 64Houston used three running backs but onlyDameon PierceandDevin Singletarygot carries.Mike Boonedid play 24 snaps and saw a 
                9.5% target share which is somewhat concerning for Pierce’s 
                fantasy outlook. Houston was searching for answers in this game 
                but if we get a repeat of this scenario in a neutral or positive 
                game script, the it will be time to panic on Pierce.Noah Brown(67.5%) was the third receiver behindNico Collins(70.1%) andRobert Woods(75.3%) butTank Delldid mix in on 48.1% 
                of the snaps. Collins (26.2%) and Woods (23.8%) dominated target 
                share.The Ravens RB situation will be a hot topic this week withJ.K. Dobbins(46.9% of snaps) out for the year with an Achilles injury.Justice Hill(29.7%) andGus Edwards(23.4%) are the in-house 
                replacements. HC John Harbaugh uttered the name “Melvin Gordon” out of his mouth as well.Odell Beckham Jr.(92.2% of snaps) was on the field a lot for 
                the Ravens butZay Flowers(84.4%) saw an outrageous 47.6% target 
                share. These two dominated in two-WR sets withRashod Bateman(39.1%) andNelson Agholor(37.5%) filling backup roles.Isaiah Likelyplayed a respectable 71.9% of the snaps withMark Andrewsinactive but saw just a 4.8% target share.Charlie Kolar(20.3% of snaps) mixed in as well.CAR @ ATLOffensive SnapsPanthers: 77Falcons: 52Carolina used just two running backs:Miles Sanders(57.1% of 
                snaps) andChuba Hubbard(36.4%). Sanders saw 22 touches (6 targets) 
                to Hubbard’s 11.Adam Thielen(88.3%),Jonathan Mingo(87%) andTerrace Marshall Jr.(89.6%) worked as the clear top three receivers for the Panthers 
                withD.J. Charkinactive. Marshall (19.4%) and Mingo (16.1%) led 
                in target share butBryce Youngstruggled to complete passes to 
                his wideouts.Tight EndHayden Hurstsaw a 22.6% target share as the leading 
                receiver (7 targets) for Carolina.Bijan Robinson(63.5% of snaps) is not going to be unleashed 
                as a workhorse back under Arthur Smith.Tyler Allgeieris gong 
                to play a lot as he did in this game (55.8 % of snaps). The good 
                thing is, Bijan (6 targets) is talented enough to get there on 
                efficiency and will be used a lot more than Allgeier in the passing 
                game.Drake Londonposted a goose egg on 1 target while playing 90.4% 
                of the snaps. The low-volume passing attack in Atlanta is going 
                to continue to be a problem for London and TEKyle Pitts.CIN @ CLEOffensive SnapsBengals: 56Browns: 74The Bengals offense never got on track in the wet conditions. 
                RookieChase Brown(Inactive) was the odd man out in the backfield 
                whileTrayveon Williams(28.6% of snaps) operated as the backup 
                behindJoe Mixon(62.5%).Chris Evansplayed just 7 snaps and 
                isn’t worth a look at this point.The Browns dominated this game which allowedJerome Ford(40.5% 
                of snaps) to get extensive work behindNick Chubb(48.6%). If 
                available, Ford will be worth a look on your waiver wire asPierre Strong Jr.didn’t see a snap in this game.Cleveland played six receivers with the main trio beingAmari Cooper(62.2%),Donovan Peoples-Jones(89.2%) andElijah Moore(68.9%). Despite playing the most snaps, DPJ saw just a 6.9% target 
                share in the sloppy conditions. Cooper and Moore both saw a 24.1% 
                target share.SF @ PITOffensive Snaps49ers: 68Steelers: 63Christian McCaffrey(85.3% of snaps) played his typical role.Elijah Mitchellplayed just 14.7% of the snaps which is concerning 
                for his stand-alone value.Brandon Aiyuk(85.3%) andDeebo Samuel(86.8%) were the only 
                noteworthy receivers for the 49ers.Jaylen Warrenplayed a healthy 39.7% of snaps whileNajee Harrisplayed 52.4%. Warren also saw a 13.3% target share. The Steelers 
                only ran the ball 10 times as they were trailing most of the game.Diontae Johnsoninjured his hamstring which limited him to 42.9% 
                of the snaps.George Pickens(88.9%),Allen Robinson(88.9%) andCalvin Austin(55.6%) rounded out the wide receiver group.ARI @ WASOffensive SnapsCardinals: 62Commanders: 71James Connerwas in a workhorse role for the Cardinals playing 
                83.9% of the snaps including a 16.7% target share.Keaontay Ingramplayed just 11.3% of snaps.Michael Wilson(90.3%),Marquise Brown(83.9%) andRondale Moore(67.7%) were the clear top three receivers for the Cardinals but 
                the low volume of passing attempts and inefficiency at the QB 
                position isn’t going to make them valuable fantasy assets.The usage forBrian Robinson Jr.(60.6%) was encouraging; not 
                so much forAntonio Gibson. Robinson played well ahead of Gibson 
                (35.2%) and Robinson saw 20 touches while Gibson (fumble) had 
                just 4 touches.Despite his toe injury,Terry McLaurinplayed 88.7% of the snaps.TB @ MINOffensive SnapsBuccaneers: 68Vikings: 64Ke'Shawn Vaughn was inactive for the Bucs. As expected,Rachaad White(79.4% of snaps) dominated the workload withSean Tucker(14.7%) andChase Edmonds(11.8%) filling the backup role.Cade Otton(97.1%) dominated snaps at tight end for Tampa Bay 
                but saw a somewhat disappointing 9.4% target share.Trey Palmer(33.8%) worked slightly ahead ofDeven Thompkins(26.5%) as the Bucs No.3 receiver but snaps and target share were 
                dominated byMike Evans(83.8%) andChris Godwin(85.3%).Alexander Mattison(73.4% of snaps) worked as the clear lead 
                RB for the Vikings with Ty Chander (17.2%) in the backup role.K.J. Osborn(90.6%) played well ahead ofJordan Addison(56.2%) 
                but both saw a 13.6% target share.The Vikings played a lot of two TE sets which allowedJosh Oliverto see a 46.9% snap share.T.J. Hockenson’s 20.5% target 
                share was 6th among TEs.JAX @ INDOffensive SnapsJaguars: 70Colts: 72Travis Etiennewas the clear lead back for the Jags, playing 
                80% of the snaps withTank Bigsbyplaying 21.4%.It didn’t take long forCalvin Ridley(81.4% of snaps) 
                to look like a dominant WR1.Zay Jonesplayed 88.6% of snaps ahead 
                ofChristian Kirk(60%) with Zay also leading in target share 
                21.9% to 9.4%.Deon Jacksongot the start at running back and played 70.8% of 
                the snaps withJake Funkplaying 18.1%. RookieEvan Hull(11.1%) 
                got banged up.The Colts WR rotation was as expected:Michael Pittman Jr.(97.2%),Alec Pierce(91.7%) andJosh Downs(79.2%).Kyle Granson (61.1%) andMo Alie-Cox(41.7%) were splitting time 
                at tight end withJelani Woodson IR.TEN @ NOOffensive SnapsTitans: 63Saints: 65RookieTyjae Spearssaw a significant 54% of the snaps but only 
                got 3 carries and 4 targets. It seems the Titans are more open 
                to lighteningDerrick Henry’s workload (47.6% of snaps), 
                at least in the early part of the season.As expected,Jamaal Williams(75.4% of snaps) dominated the backfield 
                for the Saints, he just couldn’t do anything with his opportunities.Michael Thomas(80% of snaps) andChris Olave(78.5%) were the 
                top two wideouts for the Saints withRashid Shaheed(53.8) filling 
                the No.3 role.Juwan Johnsonplayed 75.4% of the snaps and saw a 15.6% target 
                share.Taysom Hillplayed 9 snaps, got 3 carries and 1 target.LV @ DENOffensive SnapsRaiders: 59Broncos: 64It was theJosh Jacobsshow for the Raiders. Despite the holdout, 
                he played 79.7% of snaps withZamir White(8.5%) andAmeer Abdullah(11.9%) being afterthoughts.With Patrick Surtain sticking onDavante Adams(89.8%) like glue, 
                the Raiders were pepperingJakobi Meyers(79.7%) with targets 
                (10) before he suffered a concussion. We’ll see who the 
                Raiders want to use in two WR sets opposite Adams next week.Kristian Wilkerson(22%),Hunter Renfrow(22%) andDeAndre Carter(16.9%) 
                are the candidates.Tight endsAustin Hooper(52,5%) and Michael Meyer (49.2%) had 
                a near equal snap share but they totaled just 1 target.I was skepticalJavonte Williamswould play a lead role in Week 
                1 coming off his serious knee injury, but I was wrong. Williams 
                andSamaje Perineboth played 29 snaps but Williams saw 17 touches 
                (6 targets) compared to Perine’s 12 touches (4 targets). 
                I would expect a similar even split for the next few weeks.Something else I was wrong about.Marvin Mims(26.6%) was fourth 
                in snaps among Denver wideouts, playing behindCourtland Sutton(85.9%), Lil'Jordan Humphrey (70.3%) andBrandon Johnson(50%).MIA @ LACOffensive SnapsDolphins: 67Chargers: 81Raheem Mostertplayed 73.1% of the RB snaps for Miami withDevon Achaneon the Inactive list.Salvon Ahmed(28.4%) played sparingly 
                in the Dolphins shootout with the Chargers. Miami only ran the 
                ball 20 times while Tua attempted 45 passes.TheTyreek Hillshow (15-11-215-2) occurred on 65.7% of snaps. 
                Miami rotated a number of third receivers includingBraxton Berrios(52.2%),River Cracraft(40.3%) andErik Ezukanma(28.4%) whileCedrick Wilsonwas inactive.TEDurham Smytheplayed every snap for Miami and saw a 15.9% target 
                share.The Chargers ran a boatload of plays andAustin Ekeler(50.6%) 
                banged up his knee which allowedJoshua Kelley(48.1%) to see 
                16 carries but only 1 target.WRMike Williams(76.5%) missed some time in this game after 
                taking a hard shot to the chest.Josh Palmer(64.2%) played well 
                ahead of rookieQuentin Johnston(27.2%).LAR @ SEAOffensive SnapsRams: 81Seahawks: 51It wasn’t for a lack of trying asCam Akers(34.6% of snaps) 
                ran the ball 22 times for 29 yards and didn’t receive a 
                target.Kyren Williams(65.4%) should be a waiver wire darling 
                as he was a meaningful part of the Rams RB tandem with 15 carries 
                and 2 targets.The Rams couldn’t run it very well against Seattle, but 
                they sure could throw it.Puka Nacua(77.8%) andTutu Atwell(79%) 
                both topped 100-yards receiving. Nacua (15 targets) should be 
                your waiver wire preference over the 5-9 Atwell.Van Jeffersonplayed 92.6% of the snaps but was third in target share (13.5%) 
                among the wideouts.Seattle used three running backs led byKenneth Walker(62.7%), 
                followed byZach Charbonnet(23.5%) andDeeJay Dallas(21.6%). 
                A predictable usage early in the season.Jaxon Smith-Njigba(hand) played 58.8% of the snaps but this 
                offense was stuck in mud all day and only amassed 180 total yards.PHI @ NEOffensive SnapsEagles: 66Patriots: 80So, word comes out a few minutes before 1 PM Eastern thatRashaad 
                    Pennyis going to be a healthy scratch. Big things forD’Andre 
                    Swift, right? Wrong. Swift plays just 28.8% of snaps and 
                    gets two touches whileKenneth 
                    Gainwell(62.1%) gets 18 touches. After the game, Nick 
                    Sirianni said “I don't ever want to come out of a game where 
                    D'Andre Swift has only two touches.”Boston 
                    Scottplayed 8 snaps. Swift owners may have to wait for 
                    Sirianni to prove it before putting Swift back in their lineup.Only two RBs played for the Patriots:Rhamondre Stevenson(72.5%) 
                andEzekiel Elliott(35%).Kendrick Bourne(91.2%) operated as a starting wideout and saw 
                the most snaps and targets (11) of any Patriots WR.Kayshon Boutte(68.8) andJuJu Smith-Schuster(53.8%) were next in the pecking 
                order.GB @ CHIOffensive SnapsPackers: 60Bears: 74Aaron Jones(46.7%) sat out a good chunk of the 2nd half after 
                tweaking his hamstring on a 35-yard TD reception.AJ Dillon(48.3%) 
                couldn’t get anything going with just 36 yards on 15 touches.Speaking of hamstrings,Romeo Doubsplayed 48.3% of the snaps 
                whileJayden Reed(53.3%),Dontayvion Wicks(61.7%),Malik Heath(48.3%) andSamori Toure(35%) filled out the WR group.The Bears three-head running back committee was in full-effect 
                  withKhalil 
                  Herbert(36.5%),Roschon 
                  Johnson(39.2%) andD'Onta 
                  Foreman(28.4%) and taking their turn. I’d expect Herbert 
                  and Roschon to be the most fantasy friendly during the season. 
                  Note that Roschon's work came mostly in garbage time.DAL @ NYGOffensive SnapsCowboys: 58Giants: 70The Cowboys defense dominated this game resulting in a 40-0 rout. 
                As a result, the offensive output was skewed. OnlyTony Pollard(16 touches) contributed in a significant way.Rico Dowdle(15.5%) 
                andDeuce Vaughn(13.8%) aren’t going to have standalone 
                value in this offense.The receiver group played out as expected.CeeDee Lamb(73.3%),Brandin Cooks(58.6%) andMichael Gallup(67.2%) received the 
                most snaps withJalen Tolbert(27.6%) andKaVontae Turpin(19%) 
                picking up scraps.Daniel Jonesthrew for 104 yards and was under constant pressure, 
                meaning none of the Giants pass-catchers were fantasy relevant.Darius Slayton(67.1%),Parris Campbell(67.1%) andIsaiah Hodgins(60%) saw the most snaps.BUF @ NYJOffensive SnapsBills: 69Jets: 54Buffalo committed four turnovers which are drive killers.James Cook(59.4%) operated as the lead back butDamien Harris(13%) andLatavius Murray(23.2%) also got work. Murray disturbingly 
                  was in on the Bills final drive of the game during two-minute 
                  mode.No surpriseStefon Diggs(84.1%) was the alpha WR for the 
                    Bills with a 33.3% target share.Deonte Harty(21.7%) was 
                    the WR3 and matchedGabriel Davis’ 10.3% target share.Dalton Kincaid(79.7%) andDawson Knox(84.1%) saw the filed 
                    a lot and split tight end duties as the Bills used mainly 
                    2 WRs and 2 TE sets.Breece Hall’s knee looked fine as he made three huge 
                    chunk plays of 83, 26 and 20 yards, racking up 147 yards on 
                    11 touches.Dalvin Cook(50%) saw a bigger snap percentage 
                    but was noticeably inefficient with 59 yards on 16 touches.Michael Cartermixed in on 22.2% of the snaps.The Jets used mainly three WRs:Garrett Wilson(92.6%),Allen Lazard(77.8%) andRandall Cobb(40.7%).Mecole Hardmandidn’t 
                    have a snap on offense.Please enable JavaScript to view thecomments powered by Disqus.

MIN @ PHI

Offensive SnapsVikings: 58Eagles: 77Alexander Mattisonhas been above 70% of snaps in each of the first two 
                games, but has 19 carries for 62 yards.The Vikings are exclusively using three receivers:Justin Jefferson(100%),K.J. Osborn(96.6%) andJordan Addison(69%). Osborn has 
                more fantasy value that most fantasy owners realize.WithKenneth 
                Gainwellinactive it was theD’Andre 
                Swiftshow who played 75.3% of the snaps.Boston 
                Scottwas the No.2 RB whileRashaad 
                Penny(11.7%) is struggling to see the field.LV @ BUFOffensive SnapsRaiders: 40Bills: 78Kristian 
                Wilkerson(72.5%) saw the most snaps at receiver behindDavante 
                Adams(92.5%) for the Raiders.Hunter 
                Renfrow(65%) did see an uptick from his 22% of snaps played 
                in Week 1.James Cookwas efficient on his 21 touches, playing 59% of the 
                snaps. The Bills ran 78 plays and were usingLatavius Murray(23.1%) 
                in the redzone and also gotDamien Harris(17.9%) 7 touches. The 
                backup RB usage in the redzone is going to be a wet blanket on 
                Cook’s fantasy value this season.For the second-straight week the Bills used a two-tight end set 
                as their base formation withDawson Knox(70.5%) andDalton Kincaid(60.3%), meaning onlyStefon Diggs(87.2%) andGabriel Davis(74.4%) 
                are viable fantasy wideouts in Buffalo.BAL @ CINOffensive SnapsRavens: 75Bengals: 60Justice Hill(57.3%) andGus Edwards(42.7%) split running back 
                work with Hill out-touching Edwards 14 to 10. Gus had zero targets.Odell Beckham 
                Jr.(52%) left this game with an ankle injury which allowedNelson Agholor(33.3%) andRashod 
                Bateman(58.7%) to see increase work.Zay 
                Flowersplayed 77.3% of the snaps. WithMark 
                Andrews(8 targets) back in action, no receiver saw more than 
                6 targets.For the second-straight week,Trayveon Williams(16.7%) was the 
                backup toJoe Mixon(78.3%) but isn’t playing enough to 
                have stand-alone value.Chase Brownplayed 1 snap.KC @ JAXOffensive SnapsChiefs: 67Jaguars: 67The Chiefs barely ran the ball in the first half butIsiah Pacheco(50.7%) managed 70 rushing yards on 12 attempts.Jerick McKinnon(32.8%) andClyde Edwards-Helaire(16.4%) were in their typical 
                roles but didn’t get more than 4 touches.Just like Week 1, the Chiefs had all 7 of their receivers active 
                and they all saw the field withRichie James(4.5%) andJustyn Ross(13.4%) being the odd men out.Marquez Valdes-Scantling(82.1%),Justin Watson(46.3%) andSkyy Moore(58.2%) saw the most action 
                withKadarius Toneyplaying just 28.4% of the snaps. Toney and 
                Watson led the group with 5 targets.Tank Bigsbyplayed just 19.4% of the snaps whileTravis Etienneplayed 71.6%.Zay Jones(65.7%) missed some time in this game with a knee injury 
                but Jacksonville was focused on gettingChristian Kirk(80.6%) 
                the ball who saw 14 targets.Calvin Ridley(79.1%) saw 8 targets.LAC @ TENOffensive SnapsChargers: 68Titans: 65WithAustin Ekelerout,Joshua Kelleysaw a dominant 79.4% share 
                of snaps.Elijah Dotson(13.2%) was the next RB in the mix ahead 
                ofIsaiah Spiller(5.9%).Josh Palmer(54.4%) continues to work ahead of rookie WRQuentin Johnston(14.7%).Breathe easyDerrick 
                Henryfans. He saw 70.8% of snaps, well ahead of rookieTajae 
                Spears(36.9%) but Spears is likely headed for a 10-12 touch 
                role which will take some shine off Henry’s ceiling.Chris Moore(46.2%) saw and increase in snaps withDeAndre Hopkins(60.0%) playing through an ankle injury. Moore won’t have 
                any fantasy value unless Hopkins is ruled out.Chigoziem Okonkwo’s 16.7% target share ranked T-14th among 
                tight ends who played at least 25 snaps. A better effort coming 
                off his bagel in Week 1.GB @ ATLOffensive SnapsPackers: 50Falcons: 82It’s hard to pinpoint what’s going on withAJ Dillonwho looks slow and out of sync with the offense. He saw a healthy 
                68% share of snaps withAaron Jonesout, but was inefficient (15-55-0, 
                1-8-0).Patrick Taylor(22%) was next up at RB followed byEmanuel Wilson(10%).With the Packers running so few plays it was difficult for anyone 
                of the receivers to be fantasy relevant.Jayden Reed(56%) saw 
                8 targets for only 37 yards but did find the endzone twice.Romeo Doubs(76%) played the most snaps of the wideouts withDontayvion Wicks(50%) andSamori Toure(46%) also seeing significant action.If you’re still holding out hope forKyle Pitts(69.5%) 
                to become an elite fantasy tight end in this offense, it’s 
                time to pack it in.Jonnu Smithplayed 67.1% of the snaps and 
                saw 6 targets while Pitts has 4 catches in two games.SEA @ DETOffensive SnapsSeahawks: 72Lions: 66Kenneth Walker(61.1%) was inefficient on his 18 touches against 
                Detroit.Zach Charbonnetgot six touches while playing 26.4% of 
                the snaps.Jaxon Smith-Njigbaplayed 55.6% of the snaps, roughly the same 
                percentage he played in Week 1.The Lions increased the snap share ofJahmyr Gibbsfrom 27.1% 
                in Week 1 to 48.5% in Week 2, althoughDavid Montgomery(45.5%) 
                did exit early with a bruised thigh. Gibbs saw 9 targets which 
                yielded a 7-39-0 result.Josh Reynolds’ two-TD performance came on 80.3% of the 
                snaps. He’s easily the WR2 in this offense.IND @ HOUOffensive SnapsColts: 57Texans: 84Zack Mossplayed an astounding 98.2% of the snaps at RB for the 
                Colts. No other running back got an offensive snap. He’s 
                obviously the guy untilJonathan Taylorreturns.WRAlec Pierceplayed every snap whileMichael Pittman Jr.played 
                98.2%. The Colts have a tight rotation among their skill players.Dameon Piercesaw 17 touches but played just 45.2% of the snaps.Devin Singletary(35.7%) andDare Ogunbowale(19%) were also used 
                in a game that saw Houston run 84 plays.The Texans got down early and allowedC.J. Stroudto throw the 
                ball 47 times. The clear top three wideouts wereNico Collins(61.9%),Robert Woods(85.7%) andTank Dell(78.6). All three 
                saw at least 9 targets.CHI @ TBOffensive SnapsBears: 53Buccaneers: 71D’Onta Foremanwas a healthy scratch which leftKhalil 
                Herbert(60.4%) andRoschon 
                Johnson(41.5%) to soak up the running back work. The Bears 
                will need to improve their offensive efficiency in order for both 
                of these backs to be fantasy relevant.Darnell Mooney(28.3%) missed most of the second half with a 
                bruised knee which allowedChase Claypoolto lay 79.2% of the 
                snaps.Trent Taylor(43.4%) was the third WR up but has no fantasy 
                value.Chase Edmondshas been put on IR with a knee injury which should 
                giveSean Tucker(23.9%) more opportunities as the backup behindRachaad White(71.8%).Trey Palmer(49.3%) andDeven Thompkins(45.1%) are splitting 
                time as the third receiver for the Bucs behindMike Evans(60.6%) 
                andChris Godwin(74.6%).NYG @ ARIOffensive SnapsGiants: 68Cardinals: 65Saquon Barkley(97.1%) is going to miss at least a couple weeks 
                after suffering a sprained ankle in this game which is unfortunate 
                given the kind of usage he’s been seeing.Matt BreidaandGary Brightwellboth played 2 snaps in this game.The top three receivers for the Giants continue to beDarius Slayton(82.4%),Isaiah Hodgins(75%) andParris Campbell(66.2%). 
                However, TEDarren Waller(89.7%) has the highest target share 
                (20.3%) among the Giants pass catchers through two weeks.James Conner(72.3%) is dominating snap share for the Cardinals 
                at running back.Marquise Brown(93.8%) andRondale Moore(64.6%) led the Cardinals 
                receivers in snap share withMichael Wilson(43.1%) third on the 
                list. Brown has a 25.4% target share through two games.At TE,Zach Ertzis a thing. He played 72.4% of snaps this week 
                and is clearly ahead ofTrey McBride(44.1%). Ertz has 18 targets 
                on the season compared to McBride’s 5SF @ LAROffensive Snaps49ers: 57Rams: 80Christian McCaffreyhas played 92% of the snaps for the 49ers 
                this season.Elijah Mitchellcan’t sniff the field.Cam Akerswas a healthy scratch and there are now trade rumors 
                swirling. No problem… we’ll just giveKyren Williams95% of the RB snaps.Ronnie Riverswas the backup and saw 5 snaps.The Rams are basically using three receivers:Puka Nacua(86.2%),Tutu Atwell(93.8%) andVan Jefferson(82.5%). Jefferson is clearly 
                the third receiver with Puka seeing a whopping 35 targets in two 
                games.TETyler Higbeeplayed 92.5% of the snaps and saw 7 targets but 
                only had 3 catches for 12 yards.NYJ @ DALOffensive SnapsJets: 47Cowboys: 87Not surprisingly, the Jets couldn’t do anything on offense 
                against Dallas.Dalvin Cook(36.2%),Breece Hall(34%) andMichael Carter(31.9%) played a similar number of snaps.Tony Pollardgot 32 touches in this game on 64.4% of the snaps. 
                Any questions about him being a bellcow RB have been answered.Jalen Tolbert(67.8%) got a bump in usage withBrandin 
                Cooksout.CeeDee 
                LambandMichael 
                Gallupboth played 72.4% of the snaps.WAS @ DENOffensive SnapsCommanders: 73Broncos: 66Brian Robinson Jr.(52.1%) andAntonio Gibson(49.9%) played 
                similar number of snaps but Robinson out-touched Gibson 20-to-5.Samaje Perine(50%) andJavonte 
                Williams(45.5%) were basically an even split this week but 
                Williams had 14 touches to Perine’s 4.Marvin Mimsposted a 2-113-1; 2-10-0 line on 16 snaps. He’s 
                playing well behindJerry Jeudy(68.2%),Courtland Sutton(89.4%) 
                andBrandon Johnson(45.5%).MIA @ NEOffensive SnapsDolphins: 63Patriots: 74Raheem Mostert(73%) has taken over the Dolphins backfield and 
                is a solid RB2 even withDevon Achane(9.5%) back in the mix.Rhamondre Stevenson(73%) andEzekiel Elliott(29.7%) are basically 
                in a 70-30 split. Zeke is only fantasy relevant in an obvious 
                play from ahead situation for the Patriots.DeVante Parkerplayed every snap for the Patriots whileKendrick Bourne(51.4%) andJuJu Smith-Schuster(59.5%) operated as secondary 
                receivers.New England used a lot of two TE sets withHunter Henry(91.9%) 
                andMike Gesicki(71.6%). Henry is currently the TE2 after two 
                weeks.NO @ CAROffensive SnapsSaints: 77Panthers: 60Miles Sanders(61.7%) andChuba Hubbard(36.7%) were the only 
                RBs to take a snap for Carolina.Jonathan Mingo(98.3%),Adam Thielen(86.7%) andD.J. Chark(61.7%) 
                are the top three wideouts for Carolina. Mingo saw a 25.8% target 
                share but finished with an 8 (targets)-3-26-0 line.Jamaal Williams(23.4%) left early with a hamstring injury which 
                allowedTony Jones(51.9%) to get some run. He scored twice but 
                was inefficient with his carries (12-34)Kendre Millerwas Inactive 
                andAlvin Kamarawill be back in Week 4.We saw a lot ofTaysom Hill(40.3%) in this game, likely in part 
                due to Jamaal Williams leaving early. Taysom had 9 carries (75 
                yds), 1 pass attempt and 1 reception.CLE @ PITOffensive SnapsBrowns: 87Steelers: 54The Steelers won this game on defense (2 TDs) as their offense 
                struggled all night against an emerging Browns-D.Jaylen Warren(42.6%) has stand-alone value as the backup toNajee Harris(57.4%).WithDiontae Johnsonnow on IR, the Steelers rolled outGeorge Pickens(85.2%),Allen Robinson(87%) andCalvin Austin(75.9%) 
                as their top three wideouts. Pickens saw a 34.5% target share.The Browns lostNick 
                Chubb(20.7%) to a devastating knee injury which will makeJerome Ford(49.4%) a top waiver wire add. Ford operated as the lead back 
                with Chubb out whilePierre 
                Strong Jr.saw just a 14.9% snap share. Adding a free agent 
                RB is certainly in play for the Browns.Please enable JavaScript to view thecomments powered by Disqus.

Alexander Mattisonhas been above 70% of snaps in each of the first two 
                games, but has 19 carries for 62 yards.

The Vikings are exclusively using three receivers:Justin Jefferson(100%),K.J. Osborn(96.6%) andJordan Addison(69%). Osborn has 
                more fantasy value that most fantasy owners realize.

WithKenneth 
                Gainwellinactive it was theD’Andre 
                Swiftshow who played 75.3% of the snaps.Boston 
                Scottwas the No.2 RB whileRashaad 
                Penny(11.7%) is struggling to see the field.

LV @ BUF

Offensive SnapsRaiders: 40Bills: 78

Kristian 
                Wilkerson(72.5%) saw the most snaps at receiver behindDavante 
                Adams(92.5%) for the Raiders.Hunter 
                Renfrow(65%) did see an uptick from his 22% of snaps played 
                in Week 1.

James Cookwas efficient on his 21 touches, playing 59% of the 
                snaps. The Bills ran 78 plays and were usingLatavius Murray(23.1%) 
                in the redzone and also gotDamien Harris(17.9%) 7 touches. The 
                backup RB usage in the redzone is going to be a wet blanket on 
                Cook’s fantasy value this season.

For the second-straight week the Bills used a two-tight end set 
                as their base formation withDawson Knox(70.5%) andDalton Kincaid(60.3%), meaning onlyStefon Diggs(87.2%) andGabriel Davis(74.4%) 
                are viable fantasy wideouts in Buffalo.

BAL @ CIN

Justice Hill(57.3%) andGus Edwards(42.7%) split running back 
                work with Hill out-touching Edwards 14 to 10. Gus had zero targets.

Odell Beckham 
                Jr.(52%) left this game with an ankle injury which allowedNelson Agholor(33.3%) andRashod 
                Bateman(58.7%) to see increase work.Zay 
                Flowersplayed 77.3% of the snaps. WithMark 
                Andrews(8 targets) back in action, no receiver saw more than 
                6 targets.

For the second-straight week,Trayveon Williams(16.7%) was the 
                backup toJoe Mixon(78.3%) but isn’t playing enough to 
                have stand-alone value.Chase Brownplayed 1 snap.

KC @ JAX

The Chiefs barely ran the ball in the first half butIsiah Pacheco(50.7%) managed 70 rushing yards on 12 attempts.Jerick McKinnon(32.8%) andClyde Edwards-Helaire(16.4%) were in their typical 
                roles but didn’t get more than 4 touches.

Just like Week 1, the Chiefs had all 7 of their receivers active 
                and they all saw the field withRichie James(4.5%) andJustyn Ross(13.4%) being the odd men out.Marquez Valdes-Scantling(82.1%),Justin Watson(46.3%) andSkyy Moore(58.2%) saw the most action 
                withKadarius Toneyplaying just 28.4% of the snaps. Toney and 
                Watson led the group with 5 targets.

Tank Bigsbyplayed just 19.4% of the snaps whileTravis Etienneplayed 71.6%.

Zay Jones(65.7%) missed some time in this game with a knee injury 
                but Jacksonville was focused on gettingChristian Kirk(80.6%) 
                the ball who saw 14 targets.Calvin Ridley(79.1%) saw 8 targets.

LAC @ TEN

WithAustin Ekelerout,Joshua Kelleysaw a dominant 79.4% share 
                of snaps.Elijah Dotson(13.2%) was the next RB in the mix ahead 
                ofIsaiah Spiller(5.9%).

Josh Palmer(54.4%) continues to work ahead of rookie WRQuentin Johnston(14.7%).

Breathe easyDerrick 
                Henryfans. He saw 70.8% of snaps, well ahead of rookieTajae 
                Spears(36.9%) but Spears is likely headed for a 10-12 touch 
                role which will take some shine off Henry’s ceiling.

Chris Moore(46.2%) saw and increase in snaps withDeAndre Hopkins(60.0%) playing through an ankle injury. Moore won’t have 
                any fantasy value unless Hopkins is ruled out.

Chigoziem Okonkwo’s 16.7% target share ranked T-14th among 
                tight ends who played at least 25 snaps. A better effort coming 
                off his bagel in Week 1.



GB @ ATL

It’s hard to pinpoint what’s going on withAJ Dillonwho looks slow and out of sync with the offense. He saw a healthy 
                68% share of snaps withAaron Jonesout, but was inefficient (15-55-0, 
                1-8-0).Patrick Taylor(22%) was next up at RB followed byEmanuel Wilson(10%).

With the Packers running so few plays it was difficult for anyone 
                of the receivers to be fantasy relevant.Jayden Reed(56%) saw 
                8 targets for only 37 yards but did find the endzone twice.Romeo Doubs(76%) played the most snaps of the wideouts withDontayvion Wicks(50%) andSamori Toure(46%) also seeing significant action.

If you’re still holding out hope forKyle Pitts(69.5%) 
                to become an elite fantasy tight end in this offense, it’s 
                time to pack it in.Jonnu Smithplayed 67.1% of the snaps and 
                saw 6 targets while Pitts has 4 catches in two games.



SEA @ DET

Kenneth Walker(61.1%) was inefficient on his 18 touches against 
                Detroit.Zach Charbonnetgot six touches while playing 26.4% of 
                the snaps.

Jaxon Smith-Njigbaplayed 55.6% of the snaps, roughly the same 
                percentage he played in Week 1.

The Lions increased the snap share ofJahmyr Gibbsfrom 27.1% 
                in Week 1 to 48.5% in Week 2, althoughDavid Montgomery(45.5%) 
                did exit early with a bruised thigh. Gibbs saw 9 targets which 
                yielded a 7-39-0 result.

Josh Reynolds’ two-TD performance came on 80.3% of the 
                snaps. He’s easily the WR2 in this offense.



IND @ HOU

Zack Mossplayed an astounding 98.2% of the snaps at RB for the 
                Colts. No other running back got an offensive snap. He’s 
                obviously the guy untilJonathan Taylorreturns.

WRAlec Pierceplayed every snap whileMichael Pittman Jr.played 
                98.2%. The Colts have a tight rotation among their skill players.

Dameon Piercesaw 17 touches but played just 45.2% of the snaps.Devin Singletary(35.7%) andDare Ogunbowale(19%) were also used 
                in a game that saw Houston run 84 plays.

The Texans got down early and allowedC.J. Stroudto throw the 
                ball 47 times. The clear top three wideouts wereNico Collins(61.9%),Robert Woods(85.7%) andTank Dell(78.6). All three 
                saw at least 9 targets.



CHI @ TB

D’Onta Foremanwas a healthy scratch which leftKhalil 
                Herbert(60.4%) andRoschon 
                Johnson(41.5%) to soak up the running back work. The Bears 
                will need to improve their offensive efficiency in order for both 
                of these backs to be fantasy relevant.

Darnell Mooney(28.3%) missed most of the second half with a 
                bruised knee which allowedChase Claypoolto lay 79.2% of the 
                snaps.Trent Taylor(43.4%) was the third WR up but has no fantasy 
                value.

Chase Edmondshas been put on IR with a knee injury which should 
                giveSean Tucker(23.9%) more opportunities as the backup behindRachaad White(71.8%).

Trey Palmer(49.3%) andDeven Thompkins(45.1%) are splitting 
                time as the third receiver for the Bucs behindMike Evans(60.6%) 
                andChris Godwin(74.6%).



NYG @ ARI

Saquon Barkley(97.1%) is going to miss at least a couple weeks 
                after suffering a sprained ankle in this game which is unfortunate 
                given the kind of usage he’s been seeing.Matt BreidaandGary Brightwellboth played 2 snaps in this game.

The top three receivers for the Giants continue to beDarius Slayton(82.4%),Isaiah Hodgins(75%) andParris Campbell(66.2%). 
                However, TEDarren Waller(89.7%) has the highest target share 
                (20.3%) among the Giants pass catchers through two weeks.

James Conner(72.3%) is dominating snap share for the Cardinals 
                at running back.

Marquise Brown(93.8%) andRondale Moore(64.6%) led the Cardinals 
                receivers in snap share withMichael Wilson(43.1%) third on the 
                list. Brown has a 25.4% target share through two games.

At TE,Zach Ertzis a thing. He played 72.4% of snaps this week 
                and is clearly ahead ofTrey McBride(44.1%). Ertz has 18 targets 
                on the season compared to McBride’s 5

SF @ LAR

Christian McCaffreyhas played 92% of the snaps for the 49ers 
                this season.Elijah Mitchellcan’t sniff the field.

Cam Akerswas a healthy scratch and there are now trade rumors 
                swirling. No problem… we’ll just giveKyren Williams95% of the RB snaps.Ronnie Riverswas the backup and saw 5 snaps.

The Rams are basically using three receivers:Puka Nacua(86.2%),Tutu Atwell(93.8%) andVan Jefferson(82.5%). Jefferson is clearly 
                the third receiver with Puka seeing a whopping 35 targets in two 
                games.

TETyler Higbeeplayed 92.5% of the snaps and saw 7 targets but 
                only had 3 catches for 12 yards.



NYJ @ DAL

Not surprisingly, the Jets couldn’t do anything on offense 
                against Dallas.Dalvin Cook(36.2%),Breece Hall(34%) andMichael Carter(31.9%) played a similar number of snaps.

Tony Pollardgot 32 touches in this game on 64.4% of the snaps. 
                Any questions about him being a bellcow RB have been answered.

Jalen Tolbert(67.8%) got a bump in usage withBrandin 
                Cooksout.CeeDee 
                LambandMichael 
                Gallupboth played 72.4% of the snaps.



WAS @ DEN

Brian Robinson Jr.(52.1%) andAntonio Gibson(49.9%) played 
                similar number of snaps but Robinson out-touched Gibson 20-to-5.

Samaje Perine(50%) andJavonte 
                Williams(45.5%) were basically an even split this week but 
                Williams had 14 touches to Perine’s 4.

Marvin Mimsposted a 2-113-1; 2-10-0 line on 16 snaps. He’s 
                playing well behindJerry Jeudy(68.2%),Courtland Sutton(89.4%) 
                andBrandon Johnson(45.5%).



MIA @ NE

Raheem Mostert(73%) has taken over the Dolphins backfield and 
                is a solid RB2 even withDevon Achane(9.5%) back in the mix.

Rhamondre Stevenson(73%) andEzekiel Elliott(29.7%) are basically 
                in a 70-30 split. Zeke is only fantasy relevant in an obvious 
                play from ahead situation for the Patriots.

DeVante Parkerplayed every snap for the Patriots whileKendrick Bourne(51.4%) andJuJu Smith-Schuster(59.5%) operated as secondary 
                receivers.

New England used a lot of two TE sets withHunter Henry(91.9%) 
                andMike Gesicki(71.6%). Henry is currently the TE2 after two 
                weeks.



NO @ CAR

Miles Sanders(61.7%) andChuba Hubbard(36.7%) were the only 
                RBs to take a snap for Carolina.

Jonathan Mingo(98.3%),Adam Thielen(86.7%) andD.J. Chark(61.7%) 
                are the top three wideouts for Carolina. Mingo saw a 25.8% target 
                share but finished with an 8 (targets)-3-26-0 line.

Jamaal Williams(23.4%) left early with a hamstring injury which 
                allowedTony Jones(51.9%) to get some run. He scored twice but 
                was inefficient with his carries (12-34)Kendre Millerwas Inactive 
                andAlvin Kamarawill be back in Week 4.

We saw a lot ofTaysom Hill(40.3%) in this game, likely in part 
                due to Jamaal Williams leaving early. Taysom had 9 carries (75 
                yds), 1 pass attempt and 1 reception.



CLE @ PIT

The Steelers won this game on defense (2 TDs) as their offense 
                struggled all night against an emerging Browns-D.Jaylen Warren(42.6%) has stand-alone value as the backup toNajee Harris(57.4%).

WithDiontae Johnsonnow on IR, the Steelers rolled outGeorge Pickens(85.2%),Allen Robinson(87%) andCalvin Austin(75.9%) 
                as their top three wideouts. Pickens saw a 34.5% target share.

The Browns lostNick 
                Chubb(20.7%) to a devastating knee injury which will makeJerome Ford(49.4%) a top waiver wire add. Ford operated as the lead back 
                with Chubb out whilePierre 
                Strong Jr.saw just a 14.9% snap share. Adding a free agent 
                RB is certainly in play for the Browns.

Offensive SnapsGiants: 5049ers: 83WithSaquon Barkleyout, the Giants rolled withMatt Breidaon

                for 21 targets with Deebo seeing a 35.3% target share.Ray-Ray McCloud(45.8%),Jauan 
                Jennings(37.3%) and rookieRonnie

                but their running game struggles without Ekeler.Isaiah Spiller(24.2%) was the second back through ahead ofElijah Dotson(1 
                snap).Mike Williams(66.7%) will be out for the season, meaning we’ll see more ofJosh Palmer(60.6%) and rookieQuentin 
                Johnston(24.25) moving forward. Palmer has been running ahead 
                of Johnston through three weeks.Keenan Allensaw an insane 41.7% target share on way to his 20-18-215-0

                the same amount of snaps.Jordan Addison(70.7%) saw a 16.7% target share ahead ofK.J. Osborn’s (92.7%) 6.3%.BUF @ WASOffensive SnapsBills: 68Commanders: 54Latavius Murray(29.4%) andDamien Harris(13.2%) are seeing 
                just enough playing time to be annoying forJames Cook(61.8%).The Bills blowout (37-3) allowed backups to see more snaps than 
                usual.The negative game script for Washinton allowedAntonio Gibson(61.1%) to see his highest snap share of the season but he ended 
                up with just 5 touches.Brian Robinson Jr.(37%) had 10 touches… 
                all runs.WithLogan Thomasout,Cole Turner(57.4%) andJohn Bates(57.4%) 
                split the tight end work evenly. However, Turner had 7 targets 
                while Bates had 2.NO @ GBOffensive SnapsSaints: 61Packers: 79Tony 
                Jones(49.2%) out-snapped rookieKendre 
                Miller(34.4%) at running back whileTaysom 
                Hillsaw 4 carries and 1 target.Alvin

                viable.ATL @ DETOffensive SnapsFalcons: 67Lions: 70Bijan Robinson(80.6%) saw an outsized snap share overTyler Allgeier(29.9%) but the Falcons threw the ball more than they 
                typically do with just 17 carries combined for the two RBs.TEKyle Pittssaw a 23.7% target share and played 77.6% of the snaps and saw 
                9 targets with a 5-41-0 result.WithDavid Montgomeryout,Jahmyr Gibbs(60.0%) worked as the 
                main RB and saw 18 touches.Craig Reynolds(28.6%) andZonovan Knight(10%) filled the backup role.TEN @ CLEOffensive SnapsTitans: 46Browns: 71Caught in another negative game script, the Titans usedTyjae Spears(56.2%) more thanDerrick Henry(37.5%), however Henry 
                had 11 touches (all runs) compared to 8 touches for Spears.DeAndre Hopkins(72.9%),Treylon Burks(75.0%) andNick Westbrook-Ikhine(81.2%) were the top three wideouts for Tennessee.Jerome Ford(56.3%) had some help in the backfield this week, 
                withKareem Hunt(19.7%) andPierre Strong Jr.(11.3%) both seeing 
                action. Ford had just 13 touches.Elijah Moore(76.1%) saw a 29.0% target share this week and is 
                clearly the 2nd option in the passing game behindAmari Cooper(80.3%).HOU @ JAXOffensive SnapsTexans: 56Jaguars: 73Dameon Pierce(53.6%) has yet to top 20 touches in a game and 
                is averaging 2.5 yards per carry through three weeks.Tank Dell(60.7%) has solidified himself in three WR sets alongsideNico Collins(66.1%) andRobert Woods(76.8%). Dell’s 24.1% 
                target share led all Texans receivers.Travis Etienneplayed 71.2% of the snaps and logged 23 touches.

                snap share. The two RBs combined for 35 carries.DeVante Parker(76.4%),JuJu Smith-Schuster(73.6%) andKendrick Bourne(55.6%) were the top three wideouts but tight endHunter Henry(86.1%) had the highest target share (18.5%) of any receiver.The Jets offense is in bad shape withZach Wilsonat quarterback.Garrett Wilson(96.8%) andAllen Lazard(96.8%) played virtually 
                all of the snaps with Wilson clocking a 32.1% target share.The last two weeks,Breece

                and continues to play behindCourtland Sutton(95.2%),Jerry Jeudy(75.8%) andBrandon Johnson(59.7%).Adam Trautmanplayed 87.1% of the snaps for the Broncos.BothRaheem Mostert(50.7%) andDevon Achane(41.1%) ripped up 
                the Broncos defense, totaling… 8, eight, VIII touchdowns 
                combined. Both backs saw over 20 touches in the 70 to 20 beatdown 
                and combined for 375 rushing/receiving yards.IND @ BALOffensive SnapsColts: 84Ravens: 72This overtime game allowed both teams over 70 snaps.Zack Moss(76.2%) didn’t see every RB snap but he still 
                managed 32 touches and 145 yards in Week 3.Trey Sermonwas called 
                up from the practice squad and played 21.4% of the snaps.Michael Pittman Jr.played every snap.Alec Pierce(96.4%) wasn’t

Moore(100%) andChase Claypool(86.3%) played the most 
                snaps at wide receiver for the Bears.Darnell Mooney(70.6%) saw

                McKinnon(28.6%) all got in the endzone.As usual the Chiefs wide receiver rotation was spread out.Skyy Moore(64.9%),Marquez Valdes-Scantling(53.2%),Rashee Rice(50.6%),Justin Watson(40.3%) andJustyn Ross(37.7%) all played meaningful 
                snaps.Kadarius Toney(2.6%) came into the game with a toe injury 
                and barely played.PIT @ LVOffensive SnapsSteelers: 62Raiders: 72The rotation betweenNajee Harris(50.0%) andJaylen Warren(45.2%) 
                tightened this week but Najee still out-touched Warren 19 to 11.Calvin Austinplayed 72.6% of the snaps as the Steelers third 
                wideout.The Raiders passing game only has eyes forDavante Adams(97.2%) 
                andJakobi Meyers(86.1%). The two combined for a 72.8% target 
                share and 20 catches.PHI @ TBOffensive SnapsEagles: 80Buccaneers: 47D’Andre Swift(53.8%) andKenneth 
                Gainwell(46.2%) were the only running backs to play a snap 
                for the Eagles. Gainwell (15 touches) played in two-minute situations 
                which puts a cap on Swift’s upside. Swift was very efficient with 
                17 touches.Olamide Zaccheaus(55%) filled in forQuez Watkinswho was inactive.A.J. Brown(82.5%) had a 40.0% target share.Rachaad Whiteplayed on 91.5% of the snaps.Sean Tucker(8.5%) 
                was the only other running back to see a snap.Trey Palmer(72.3%) was operating as the third receiver for the 
                Bucs but only saw 1 target compared toDeven Thompkins(21.3%) 
                who saw 4 targets.LAR @ CINOffensive SnapsRams: 55Bengals: 77The Rams struggled to move the ball against the Bengals but we 
                got another insane usage game from RBKyren Williamswho played 
                every snap. He played 95% of the snaps last week and now has 17 
                targets in the last two games.The Rams tight receiver rotation continues withPuka Nacua(96.4%),Tutu Atwell(87.3%) andVan Jefferson(92.7%). Atwell led the

                at tight end. Hudson (4) saw the most targets.Ja’Marr Chasesaw a 32.6% target share and finished with 15-12-141-0.Please enable JavaScript to view thecomments powered by Disqus.

WithSaquon Barkleyout, the Giants rolled withMatt Breidaon 
                82% of the snaps. However, the offense was anemic which resulted 
                in a 4-17-1; 3 (targets)-3-1-0 line for Breida.Gary Brightwellplayed 18% of the snaps.

Wan’Dale 
                Robinsonsaw his first action of the season playing on 22%

LAC @ MIN

Offensive SnapsChargers: 66Vikings: 82

Joshua Kelley(72.7%) dominated snap share at RB for the Chargers 
                but their running game struggles without Ekeler.Isaiah Spiller(24.2%) was the second back through ahead ofElijah Dotson(1 
                snap).

Mike Williams(66.7%) will be out for the season, meaning we’ll see more ofJosh Palmer(60.6%) and rookieQuentin 
                Johnston(24.25) moving forward. Palmer has been running ahead 
                of Johnston through three weeks.

BUF @ WAS

Latavius Murray(29.4%) andDamien Harris(13.2%) are seeing 
                just enough playing time to be annoying forJames Cook(61.8%).

The Bills blowout (37-3) allowed backups to see more snaps than 
                usual.

The negative game script for Washinton allowedAntonio Gibson(61.1%) to see his highest snap share of the season but he ended 
                up with just 5 touches.Brian Robinson Jr.(37%) had 10 touches… 
                all runs.

WithLogan Thomasout,Cole Turner(57.4%) andJohn Bates(57.4%) 
                split the tight end work evenly. However, Turner had 7 targets 
                while Bates had 2.

NO @ GB

Tony 
                Jones(49.2%) out-snapped rookieKendre

                target share.

AJ Dillon’s (51.9%) woes continue. WithAaron Jonesout, 
                he lost playing time toPatrick Taylor(39.2%) andEmanuel Wilson(10.1%).

Romeo Doubs(86.1%),Jayden Reed(65.8%) andDontayvion Wicks(65.8%) continue to be the top three receivers whenChristian Watsonis out. Doubs (27.9% target share) and Reed are fantasy 
                viable.

ATL @ DET

Bijan Robinson(80.6%) saw an outsized snap share overTyler Allgeier(29.9%) but the Falcons threw the ball more than they 
                typically do with just 17 carries combined for the two RBs.

TEKyle Pittssaw a 23.7% target share and played 77.6% of the snaps and saw 
                9 targets with a 5-41-0 result.

WithDavid Montgomeryout,Jahmyr Gibbs(60.0%) worked as the 
                main RB and saw 18 touches.Craig Reynolds(28.6%) andZonovan Knight(10%) filled the backup role.



TEN @ CLE

Caught in another negative game script, the Titans usedTyjae Spears(56.2%) more thanDerrick Henry(37.5%), however Henry 
                had 11 touches (all runs) compared to 8 touches for Spears.

DeAndre Hopkins(72.9%),Treylon Burks(75.0%) andNick Westbrook-Ikhine(81.2%) were the top three wideouts for Tennessee.

Jerome Ford(56.3%) had some help in the backfield this week, 
                withKareem Hunt(19.7%) andPierre Strong Jr.(11.3%) both seeing 
                action. Ford had just 13 touches.

Elijah Moore(76.1%) saw a 29.0% target share this week and is 
                clearly the 2nd option in the passing game behindAmari Cooper(80.3%).



HOU @ JAX

Dameon Pierce(53.6%) has yet to top 20 touches in a game and 
                is averaging 2.5 yards per carry through three weeks.

Tank Dell(60.7%) has solidified himself in three WR sets alongsideNico Collins(66.1%) andRobert Woods(76.8%). Dell’s 24.1% 
                target share led all Texans receivers.

Travis Etienneplayed 71.2% of the snaps and logged 23 touches. 
                He remains a solid lead RB.

                while TEEvan Engramsaw a 20% target share.



NE @ NYJ

Ezekiel Elliott(37.5%) saw his biggest workload of the season 
                with 17 touches despite trailingRhamondre Stevenson(65.3%) in 
                snap share. The two RBs combined for 35 carries.

DeVante Parker(76.4%),JuJu Smith-Schuster(73.6%) andKendrick Bourne(55.6%) were the top three wideouts but tight endHunter Henry(86.1%) had the highest target share (18.5%) of any receiver.

The Jets offense is in bad shape withZach Wilsonat quarterback.Garrett Wilson(96.8%) andAllen Lazard(96.8%) played virtually 
                all of the snaps with Wilson clocking a 32.1% target share.

The last two weeks,Breece 
                Hall(49.2%) has 16 carries for 27 yards.Dalvin 
                Cook(25.4%) has 12 carries for 25 yards.

                usage. His snap share the first three weeks: 26.6%, 24.2%, 24.2% 
                and continues to play behindCourtland Sutton(95.2%),Jerry Jeudy(75.8%) andBrandon Johnson(59.7%).

Adam Trautmanplayed 87.1% of the snaps for the Broncos.

BothRaheem Mostert(50.7%) andDevon Achane(41.1%) ripped up

                combined. Both backs saw over 20 touches in the 70 to 20 beatdown

                up from the practice squad and played 21.4% of the snaps.

                far behind. Pittman has double-digit targets in every game.

Another week, more injuries for the Ravens.Gus Edwards(44.4%) 
                left with a concussion, leavingMelvin Gordon(40.3%) andKenyan Drake(15.3%) as the two healthy running backs.

                share and 20 catches.



PHI @ TB

D’Andre Swift(53.8%) andKenneth 
                Gainwell(46.2%) were the only running backs to play a snap 
                for the Eagles. Gainwell (15 touches) played in two-minute situations 
                which puts a cap on Swift’s upside. Swift was very efficient with 
                17 touches.

                who saw 4 targets.



LAR @ CIN

Offensive SnapsRams: 55Bengals: 77

The Rams struggled to move the ball against the Bengals but we 
                got another insane usage game from RBKyren Williamswho played 
                every snap. He played 95% of the snaps last week and now has 17 
                targets in the last two games.

The Rams tight receiver rotation continues withPuka Nacua(96.4%),Tutu Atwell(87.3%) andVan Jefferson(92.7%). Atwell led the 
                group with a 28.1% target share.

Trayveon Williams(18.2%) continues to serve as the backup toJoe Mixon(75.3%).Chase Brownplayed 1 snap.

WithIrv Smithout, the Bengals usedTanner Hudson(46.8%),Mitchell Wilcox(41.6%) andDrew Sample(44.2%) as a three-headed committee 
                at tight end. Hudson (4) saw the most targets.

Travis Etienne(84.8%) continues to have a strong role but has 
                lacked efficiency over the first four weeks (just 3.8 yards per

                by the Seahawks defense (11 sacks). The Giants continued to slam 
                Breida up the middle which wasn’t working (14 carries, 30 
                yds).

Gary Brightwell(25.3%) was the clear backup to Breida. The Giants 
                need Saquon back.

Wan’Dale 
                Robinson(64.0%) saw an increased snap share and played ahead 
                ofParris 
                Campbell(30.7%),Isaiah 
                Hodgins(37.3%) andJalin 
                Hyatt(60.0%).Darius 
                Slayton(88%) was out there the most but it’s tough to trust 
                and wide receiver on this team.

CHI @ WAS

Offensive SnapsBears: 64Commanders: 70Chicago ran into all kinds of problems at running back this week.Khalil Herbert(65.6%), Rochon Johnson (9.4%) andTravis 
                Homer(0%) were all active and all got injured.D’Onta 
                Foremanwas inactive. Monitor the injury status of this group 
                to see if Foreman will have any value moving forward.Running backs didn’t matter for the Bears asD.J. Moore(87.5%) went ham with 10 targets, 8 catches, 230 yards and 3 TDs. 
                His 10 targets represented a 40% target share.Darnell Mooney(78.1%) had 4 targets and zero catches.TECole Kmet(82.8%) saw a 20% target share and is the only other 
                notable pass-catcher in the offense.Equanimeous St. Brown(37.5%) has moved into the No.3 WR role 
                for the Bears bud doesn't have any fantasy value.The Commanders fell behind early and only ran the ball 10 times.Brian Robinson Jr.(35.7%) played fewer snaps thanAntonio Gibson(54.3%) but out-touched Gibson 10 to 4. Robinson is the better 
                fantasy play when Washington is in positive or neutral game script.It was a quiet night forTerry McLaurin(82.9%) andJahan Dotson(80%) asCurtis Samuel(70%) and tight endLogan Thomas(78.6%) 
                got the most receiving work. Thomas led the group with a 22.9% 
                target share.JAX @ BUFOffensive SnapsJaguars: 88Bills: 60Jaguars ran more plays than anyone else in the league this week. 
                Not surprisinglyTravis Etienne(83.0%) had his best fantasy game 
                of the season (26-136-2, 4-48-0).Tank Bigsby(14.8%) isn’t 
                being used enough for stand-alone value.Zay Jones(43.2%) missed the last two weeks and had to leave 
                this game with a knee injury.Calvin Ridley(85.2%) andChristian Kirk(83.0%) are the receivers to have here. Both saw a 21.6% 
                target share this week along with TEEvan Engram(85.2%).The Bills were having trouble sustaining drives which led to 
                a bad day at the office forJames Cook(61.7%).Latavius Murray(18.3%) andDamien Harris(18.3%) are still involved which caps 
                Cook’s upside as an RB2.Buffalo rotates their third receiver which makes all of them 
                unplayable as Flex options.Stefon Diggs(86.7%) andGabriel Davis(90.0%) both cracked 100-yards in this game.Dawson Knox(70.0%) out-snappedDalton 
                Kincaid(53.3%). Kincaid’s snap share has hovered in the 50’s 
                the last three weeks compared to 79.7% in Week 1.NYG @ MIAOffensive SnapsGiants: 72Dolphins: 54The anemic Giants offense switched up their backup running back 
                this week.Eric Grayplayed 41.7% of the snaps behindMatt Breida(58.3%) whileGary Brightwell(0%) stuck the sidelines. Only Breida 
                is viable as a desperation play.Darius Slayton(68.1%) andWan’Dale 
                Robinson(66.7%) played the most snaps at WR for the Giants 
                but Robinson left with a concussion and they still used six receivers 
                which makes all them less than ideal in your starting lineup.Darren Waller(91.7%) had his best fantasy game of the season 
                (8-86-0) and saw a 36.7% target share.Miami was so efficient in their dismantling of the Giants that 
                they only ran 54 plays.Raheem 
                Mostert(59.3%) andDevon 
                Achane(48.1%) both got 12 opportunities. Achane is averaging 
                12.1 yards per carry (38 rush attempts) and has scored 7 times 
                in five weeks. Who says you need volume to be a RB1?Tyreek Hill(8-181-1) saw a 32.1% target share while playing 
                just 46.3% of the snaps.Cedrick Wilsonpicked up the slack from 
                Tyreek playing 53.7% of the snaps.Jaylen Waddle(81.5%) and Hill 
                are the only two wideouts to consider.NO @ NEOffensive SnapsSaints: 72Patriots: 54Kendre Miller(36.1%) took over the backup running back role 
                for the Saints this week behindAlvin Kamara(62.5%) and looks 
                to be a good bench stash moving forward.WithJuwan Johnsonout, the Saints usedFoster Moreau(66.7%) 
                andJimmy Graham(37.5%) to fill the void, whileTaysom Hill(38.9%) 
                played his typical role. You can avoid everyone but Taysom in 
                this scenario.It’s a struggle to find any fantasy value with the Patriots 
                right now.Rhamondre Stevenson(50.0%) andEzekiel Elliott(46.3%) 
                continue to share playing time but it’s difficult to recommend 
                them as Flex options given the state of the offense.Kendrick Bourne(87.0%) andDeVante Parker(98.1%) are the top 
                two wideouts but until this offense shows some signs of the life 
                they can be left on your bench.JuJu Smith-Schuster(50.0%) left 
                with a head injury.BAL @ PITOffensive SnapsRavens: 70Steelers: 66Gus Edwards(42.9%) andJustice Hill(55.7%) split the running 
                back duties for the Ravens. Hill is the preferred option here 
                as he works in the receiving game.Zay Flowers(98.6%) continues to be the dominant WR in the Ravens offense 
                (28.9% target share) and the only wideout to consider for your 
                starting lineup.Rashod 
                Bateman(38.6%),Nelson 
                Agholor(58.6%) andOdell 
                Beckham Jr.(52.9%) are secondary pieces that don’t have enough 
                value in an offense that has TEMark 
                Andrewssoaking up a 26.3% target share.We’re almost at an equal split betweenNajee 
                Harris(56.1%) andJaylen 
                Warren(48.5%) in snap share. Harris is still getting a few 
                more touches but it’s easy to see Warren the better player and 
                the preferred fantasy back to have in this offense.George Pickens(87.9%) posted a 6-130-1 line on a 32.3% target 
                share.Allen Robinson(86.4%) andCalvin Austin(56.1%) aren’t 
                fantasy viable.WithPat Freiermuthout,Darnell Washingtonplayed 69.7% of the 
                snaps and saw 2 targets with zero catches.CAR @ DETOffensive SnapsPanthers: 71Lions: 60Miles Sanders(46.5%) not only lost a fumble but is losing snap 
                share toChuba Hubbard(49.9%). The Panthers were down early so 
                we don’t want to read too much into this but it wouldn’t 
                be surprising to see a more even split moving between the two 
                Carolina backs moving forward.Adam Thielen(97.2%) saw a 37.1% target share and continues to 
                be viable weekly fantasy option especially in PPR leagues. He 
                has two 100-yard game and 3 TDs in five games.D.J. Chark(98.6%) 
                andJonathan Mingo(85.9%) were the top three wide receivers and 
                this trend should continue as long as they are healthy.The Lions came into this game short-handed at running back and 
                wide receiver withJahmyr 
                GibbsandAmon-Ra 
                St. Browninactive.David 
                Montgomery(75.0%) saw 21 touches whileCraig 
                Reynolds(21.7%) filled the backup role with 7 touches.We knewJameson Williams(46.7%) was going to be on a snap count 
                in his first game this season.Marvin Jones(58.3%),Kalif Raymond(48.3%) andJosh Reynolds(46.7%) all saw significant action. 
                Reynolds led the group with a 18.5% target share but Goff only 
                had 28 attempts.TESam LaPorta(86.7%) continues to be a monster, scoring twice 
                on only 4 targets.HOU @ ATLOffensive SnapsTexans: 58Falcons: 77Dameon Piercesaw high 87.0% rush share despite playing just 
                58.6% of the snaps. He’s been inefficient to start the season 
                with just 2.9 yards per carry.Devin Singletary(29.3%) did have 
                a carry.Tank Dell(36.2%) left this game with a concussion which allowedJohn Metchieto play 43.1% of the snaps.TEDalton Schultz(58.6%) saw a 31.3% target share, easily his 
                highest of the season.A result that should surprise nobody,Tyler Allgeier(44.2%) 
                saw 17 touches compared toBijan Robinson’s (61.0%) 16. 
                This is a slight dip for Bijan and a reminder that Allgeier is 
                going to be used in this offense on a weekly basis.It was tight end week across the league indicated byKyle Pitts(53.2%) finally seeing some action (11 targets) with a 28.9% target 
                share. Fellow tight endJonnu Smith(63.6%) is still involved 
                and finished with a 6-67-0 line.TEN @ INDOffensive SnapsTitans: 60Colts: 66Tyjae Spears(51.7%) continues to see significant playing time 
                for the Titans. His TD came on an end-around and he now has at 
                least 4 targets in four of five games.DeAndre Hopkins(83.3%) saw a high 32.4% target share. WithTreylon Burksstill sidelined,Nick Westbrook-Ikhine(70.0%) saw the biggest 
                snap share of the secondary receivers but he isn’t fantasy 
                viable.Jonathan Taylor’s return to action was limited to just 
                10 snaps which allowedZack Moss(80.3%) to dominate the slate 
                and finish with a 23-16-2, 2-30-0 line. We may not get a full 
                workload from Taylor for a few weeks.WRJosh Downs(71.2%) saw a 25% target share whileAlec Pierce(98.5%) saw just an 8.3% target share. Downs has twice as many 
                targets than Pierce through give games.Expect QBAnthony Richardsonto miss several weeks with a shoulder 
                injury.CIN @ ARIOffensive SnapsBengals: 82Cardinals: 57Joe Mixon(76.8%) has multiple opportunities at the goaline but 
                couldn’t score. His 29 touches were second on the week behind 
                Travis Etienne’s 30.NoTee Higgins, 
                no problem. Just throw it toJa’Marr 
                Chase(92.7%). He had a whopping 43.2% target share and finished 
                with 15-192-3.Trenton 
                Irwin(75.6%) filled the Higgins role withTyler 
                Boyd(73.2%) seeing 7 targets.James Conner(21.1%) left this game with a knee injury which 
                allowedEmari Demercado(77.2%) to see 11 touches. Demercado is 
                worth a bench stash in deeper leagues.Marquise Brown(91.2%) saw a 33.3% target share whileRondale Moore(66.7%) broke another long run (41 yds) going 3-50-0 on 
                the ground. Moore is too inconsistent to be counted on as a Flex 
                spot in 12-team leagues.PHI @ LAROffensive SnapsEagles: 79Rams: 56The Eagles running back rotation remains consistent withD’Andre 
                Swift(62.0%) andKenneth 
                Gainwell(38.0%) taking all the snaps.It wouldn’t be tight end week withoutDallas Goedert(94.9%) 
                joining in the fun. There are a lot of weapons on the Eagles offense 
                so it might be a while before we see another Goedert game like 
                this (8-117-1).The Rams welcomed the return ofCooper Kupp(94.6%) which took 
                away some of the target upside forKyren Williams(83.9%). Williams 
                is still a solid RB2 with a high snap share.No restrictions for Kupp as he saw 35.3% target share and finished 
                with 8-118-0. What’s more encouraging is thatPuka Nacuaplayed every snap and saw a 32.4% target share.Tutu Atwell(89.3%) 
                was the third receiver which leftVan Jefferson(3.6%) out in 
                the cold. He can be dropped.KC @ MINOffensive SnapsChiefs: 66Vikings: 72The Chiefs three-headed running back attack is still plodding 
                along.Isiah 
                Pacheco(59.1%) is the only one worth considering unless an 
                injury occurs.The WR room still has too many bodies to be fantasy reliable 
                withMarquez Valdes-Scantling(65.2%),Skyy Moore(56.1%),Justin Watson(43.9%),Kadarius Toney(37.9%) andRashee Rice(30.3%) 
                all rotating in. IfTravis Kelce(ankle) sits in Week 6, it may 
                force one of this group to take a leap forward.Cam Akers(29.2%) has solidified his spot as the No.2 RB in Minnesota 
                but is still behindAlexander Mattison(51.4%). The Vikings are 
                a pass-heavy team that turns the ball over which forces them to 
                abandon the running game.Justin Jefferson(70.8%) left in the 4th quarter with a hamstring 
                injury. The biggest usage bump as result was forBrandon Powell(30.6%).K.J. Osborn(88.9%) andJordan Addison(75.0%) would 
                be the top two fantasy options if Jefferson misses any time.NYJ @ DENOffensive SnapsJets: 65Broncos: 63Breece Hall’s snap shares: Wk1 – 31.5%, Wk2 – 
                34.0%, Wk 3 – 49.2%, Wk4 – 44.1%, Wk 5 – 52.3%. 
                While he’s still sharing time withDalvin CookandMichael Carter, it’s notable he had a 68.8% rush share this week 
                against the Broncos, by far his highest percentage of the season. 
                We should expect this kind of usage moving forward making him 
                a low-end RB1.WithJavonte Williamsinactive,Jaleel McLaughlin(33.3%) andSamaje Perine(60.3%) split the RB work. McLaughlin had 12 touches 
                to Perine’s 10. Both should be owned and can be deployed 
                as a Flex with McLaughlin being the preferred option.Marvin Mims(31.7%) continues to play behindBrandon Johnson(50.8%) in the Broncos third WR spot.DAL @ SFOffensive SnapsCowboys: 4949ers: 71The Cowboys got blasted by the 49ers and couldn’t move 
                the ball on offense. Nothing to see here.Elijah Mitchellwas inactive leading toJordan Mason(18.3%) 
                filling the backup RB role behindChristian McCaffrey(73.2%).Brandon Aiyuk(78.9%) saw a 28.0% target share whileDeebo Samuel(73.2%) is playing through multiple injuries.Tight End week saw three TDs fromGeorge Kittle(78.9%) on 4 
                targets.GB @ LVOffensive SnapsPackers: 58Raiders: 64Reportedly,Aaron Joneswas set to be a big part of the gameplan 
                but he was Inactive due to a hamstring injury.AJ Dillon(63.8%) 
                shared RB duties withPatrick Taylor(36.2%) with Dillon seeing 
                20 carries for 76 yds and 1 TD. Taylor had 4 touches.Christian Watson(84.5%) was back in a full-time role after being 
                limited last week with a hamstring injury.Romeo Doubs(86.2%) 
                was the only other Packers’ receiver to play more than 22% 
                of the snaps.Another day at the inefficient office forJosh Jacobs(84.4%). 
                Dude’s getting all the work though with 25 touches in this 
                game. He’s averaging 2.9 yards per carry this season.Davante Adams(93.8%) andJakobi Meyers(95.3%) continue to dominant 
                the receiving work for Las Vegas.Please enable JavaScript to view thecomments powered by Disqus.

Chicago ran into all kinds of problems at running back this week.Khalil Herbert(65.6%), Rochon Johnson (9.4%) andTravis 
                Homer(0%) were all active and all got injured.D’Onta 
                Foremanwas inactive. Monitor the injury status of this group 
                to see if Foreman will have any value moving forward.

Running backs didn’t matter for the Bears asD.J. Moore(87.5%) went ham with 10 targets, 8 catches, 230 yards and 3 TDs. 
                His 10 targets represented a 40% target share.Darnell Mooney(78.1%) had 4 targets and zero catches.

TECole Kmet(82.8%) saw a 20% target share and is the only other 
                notable pass-catcher in the offense.

Equanimeous St. Brown(37.5%) has moved into the No.3 WR role 
                for the Bears bud doesn't have any fantasy value.

The Commanders fell behind early and only ran the ball 10 times.Brian Robinson Jr.(35.7%) played fewer snaps thanAntonio Gibson(54.3%) but out-touched Gibson 10 to 4. Robinson is the better 
                fantasy play when Washington is in positive or neutral game script.

It was a quiet night forTerry McLaurin(82.9%) andJahan Dotson(80%) asCurtis Samuel(70%) and tight endLogan Thomas(78.6%) 
                got the most receiving work. Thomas led the group with a 22.9% 
                target share.



JAX @ BUF

Offensive SnapsJaguars: 88Bills: 60

Jaguars ran more plays than anyone else in the league this week. 
                Not surprisinglyTravis Etienne(83.0%) had his best fantasy game 
                of the season (26-136-2, 4-48-0).Tank Bigsby(14.8%) isn’t 
                being used enough for stand-alone value.

Zay Jones(43.2%) missed the last two weeks and had to leave 
                this game with a knee injury.Calvin Ridley(85.2%) andChristian Kirk(83.0%) are the receivers to have here. Both saw a 21.6% 
                target share this week along with TEEvan Engram(85.2%).

The Bills were having trouble sustaining drives which led to 
                a bad day at the office forJames Cook(61.7%).Latavius Murray(18.3%) andDamien Harris(18.3%) are still involved which caps 
                Cook’s upside as an RB2.

Buffalo rotates their third receiver which makes all of them 
                unplayable as Flex options.Stefon Diggs(86.7%) andGabriel Davis(90.0%) both cracked 100-yards in this game.

Dawson Knox(70.0%) out-snappedDalton 
                Kincaid(53.3%). Kincaid’s snap share has hovered in the 50’s 
                the last three weeks compared to 79.7% in Week 1.



NYG @ MIA

The anemic Giants offense switched up their backup running back 
                this week.Eric Grayplayed 41.7% of the snaps behindMatt Breida(58.3%) whileGary Brightwell(0%) stuck the sidelines. Only Breida 
                is viable as a desperation play.

Darius Slayton(68.1%) andWan’Dale 
                Robinson(66.7%) played the most snaps at WR for the Giants 
                but Robinson left with a concussion and they still used six receivers 
                which makes all them less than ideal in your starting lineup.

Darren Waller(91.7%) had his best fantasy game of the season 
                (8-86-0) and saw a 36.7% target share.

Miami was so efficient in their dismantling of the Giants that 
                they only ran 54 plays.Raheem 
                Mostert(59.3%) andDevon 
                Achane(48.1%) both got 12 opportunities. Achane is averaging 
                12.1 yards per carry (38 rush attempts) and has scored 7 times 
                in five weeks. Who says you need volume to be a RB1?

Tyreek Hill(8-181-1) saw a 32.1% target share while playing 
                just 46.3% of the snaps.Cedrick Wilsonpicked up the slack from 
                Tyreek playing 53.7% of the snaps.Jaylen Waddle(81.5%) and Hill 
                are the only two wideouts to consider.

NO @ NE

Kendre Miller(36.1%) took over the backup running back role 
                for the Saints this week behindAlvin Kamara(62.5%) and looks 
                to be a good bench stash moving forward.

WithJuwan Johnsonout, the Saints usedFoster Moreau(66.7%) 
                andJimmy Graham(37.5%) to fill the void, whileTaysom Hill(38.9%) 
                played his typical role. You can avoid everyone but Taysom in 
                this scenario.

It’s a struggle to find any fantasy value with the Patriots 
                right now.Rhamondre Stevenson(50.0%) andEzekiel Elliott(46.3%) 
                continue to share playing time but it’s difficult to recommend 
                them as Flex options given the state of the offense.

Kendrick Bourne(87.0%) andDeVante Parker(98.1%) are the top 
                two wideouts but until this offense shows some signs of the life 
                they can be left on your bench.JuJu Smith-Schuster(50.0%) left 
                with a head injury.

BAL @ PIT

Gus Edwards(42.9%) andJustice Hill(55.7%) split the running 
                back duties for the Ravens. Hill is the preferred option here 
                as he works in the receiving game.

Zay Flowers(98.6%) continues to be the dominant WR in the Ravens offense 
                (28.9% target share) and the only wideout to consider for your 
                starting lineup.Rashod 
                Bateman(38.6%),Nelson 
                Agholor(58.6%) andOdell 
                Beckham Jr.(52.9%) are secondary pieces that don’t have enough 
                value in an offense that has TEMark 
                Andrewssoaking up a 26.3% target share.

We’re almost at an equal split betweenNajee 
                Harris(56.1%) andJaylen 
                Warren(48.5%) in snap share. Harris is still getting a few 
                more touches but it’s easy to see Warren the better player and 
                the preferred fantasy back to have in this offense.

George Pickens(87.9%) posted a 6-130-1 line on a 32.3% target 
                share.Allen Robinson(86.4%) andCalvin Austin(56.1%) aren’t 
                fantasy viable.

WithPat Freiermuthout,Darnell Washingtonplayed 69.7% of the 
                snaps and saw 2 targets with zero catches.



CAR @ DET

Miles Sanders(46.5%) not only lost a fumble but is losing snap 
                share toChuba Hubbard(49.9%). The Panthers were down early so 
                we don’t want to read too much into this but it wouldn’t 
                be surprising to see a more even split moving between the two 
                Carolina backs moving forward.

Adam Thielen(97.2%) saw a 37.1% target share and continues to 
                be viable weekly fantasy option especially in PPR leagues. He 
                has two 100-yard game and 3 TDs in five games.D.J. Chark(98.6%) 
                andJonathan Mingo(85.9%) were the top three wide receivers and 
                this trend should continue as long as they are healthy.

The Lions came into this game short-handed at running back and 
                wide receiver withJahmyr 
                GibbsandAmon-Ra 
                St. Browninactive.David 
                Montgomery(75.0%) saw 21 touches whileCraig 
                Reynolds(21.7%) filled the backup role with 7 touches.

We knewJameson Williams(46.7%) was going to be on a snap count 
                in his first game this season.Marvin Jones(58.3%),Kalif Raymond(48.3%) andJosh Reynolds(46.7%) all saw significant action. 
                Reynolds led the group with a 18.5% target share but Goff only 
                had 28 attempts.

TESam LaPorta(86.7%) continues to be a monster, scoring twice 
                on only 4 targets.



HOU @ ATL

Dameon Piercesaw high 87.0% rush share despite playing just 
                58.6% of the snaps. He’s been inefficient to start the season 
                with just 2.9 yards per carry.Devin Singletary(29.3%) did have 
                a carry.

Tank Dell(36.2%) left this game with a concussion which allowedJohn Metchieto play 43.1% of the snaps.

TEDalton Schultz(58.6%) saw a 31.3% target share, easily his 
                highest of the season.

A result that should surprise nobody,Tyler Allgeier(44.2%) 
                saw 17 touches compared toBijan Robinson’s (61.0%) 16. 
                This is a slight dip for Bijan and a reminder that Allgeier is 
                going to be used in this offense on a weekly basis.

It was tight end week across the league indicated byKyle Pitts(53.2%) finally seeing some action (11 targets) with a 28.9% target 
                share. Fellow tight endJonnu Smith(63.6%) is still involved 
                and finished with a 6-67-0 line.



TEN @ IND

Tyjae Spears(51.7%) continues to see significant playing time 
                for the Titans. His TD came on an end-around and he now has at 
                least 4 targets in four of five games.

DeAndre Hopkins(83.3%) saw a high 32.4% target share. WithTreylon Burksstill sidelined,Nick Westbrook-Ikhine(70.0%) saw the biggest 
                snap share of the secondary receivers but he isn’t fantasy 
                viable.

Jonathan Taylor’s return to action was limited to just 
                10 snaps which allowedZack Moss(80.3%) to dominate the slate 
                and finish with a 23-16-2, 2-30-0 line. We may not get a full 
                workload from Taylor for a few weeks.

WRJosh Downs(71.2%) saw a 25% target share whileAlec Pierce(98.5%) saw just an 8.3% target share. Downs has twice as many 
                targets than Pierce through give games.

Expect QBAnthony Richardsonto miss several weeks with a shoulder 
                injury.



CIN @ ARI

Joe Mixon(76.8%) has multiple opportunities at the goaline but 
                couldn’t score. His 29 touches were second on the week behind 
                Travis Etienne’s 30.

NoTee Higgins, 
                no problem. Just throw it toJa’Marr 
                Chase(92.7%). He had a whopping 43.2% target share and finished 
                with 15-192-3.Trenton 
                Irwin(75.6%) filled the Higgins role withTyler 
                Boyd(73.2%) seeing 7 targets.

James Conner(21.1%) left this game with a knee injury which 
                allowedEmari Demercado(77.2%) to see 11 touches. Demercado is 
                worth a bench stash in deeper leagues.

Marquise Brown(91.2%) saw a 33.3% target share whileRondale Moore(66.7%) broke another long run (41 yds) going 3-50-0 on 
                the ground. Moore is too inconsistent to be counted on as a Flex 
                spot in 12-team leagues.



PHI @ LAR

The Eagles running back rotation remains consistent withD’Andre 
                Swift(62.0%) andKenneth 
                Gainwell(38.0%) taking all the snaps.

It wouldn’t be tight end week withoutDallas Goedert(94.9%) 
                joining in the fun. There are a lot of weapons on the Eagles offense 
                so it might be a while before we see another Goedert game like 
                this (8-117-1).

The Rams welcomed the return ofCooper Kupp(94.6%) which took 
                away some of the target upside forKyren Williams(83.9%). Williams 
                is still a solid RB2 with a high snap share.

No restrictions for Kupp as he saw 35.3% target share and finished 
                with 8-118-0. What’s more encouraging is thatPuka Nacuaplayed every snap and saw a 32.4% target share.Tutu Atwell(89.3%) 
                was the third receiver which leftVan Jefferson(3.6%) out in 
                the cold. He can be dropped.



KC @ MIN

The Chiefs three-headed running back attack is still plodding 
                along.Isiah 
                Pacheco(59.1%) is the only one worth considering unless an 
                injury occurs.

The WR room still has too many bodies to be fantasy reliable 
                withMarquez Valdes-Scantling(65.2%),Skyy Moore(56.1%),Justin Watson(43.9%),Kadarius Toney(37.9%) andRashee Rice(30.3%) 
                all rotating in. IfTravis Kelce(ankle) sits in Week 6, it may 
                force one of this group to take a leap forward.

Cam Akers(29.2%) has solidified his spot as the No.2 RB in Minnesota 
                but is still behindAlexander Mattison(51.4%). The Vikings are 
                a pass-heavy team that turns the ball over which forces them to 
                abandon the running game.

Justin Jefferson(70.8%) left in the 4th quarter with a hamstring 
                injury. The biggest usage bump as result was forBrandon Powell(30.6%).K.J. Osborn(88.9%) andJordan Addison(75.0%) would 
                be the top two fantasy options if Jefferson misses any time.



NYJ @ DEN

Breece Hall’s snap shares: Wk1 – 31.5%, Wk2 – 
                34.0%, Wk 3 – 49.2%, Wk4 – 44.1%, Wk 5 – 52.3%. 
                While he’s still sharing time withDalvin CookandMichael Carter, it’s notable he had a 68.8% rush share this week 
                against the Broncos, by far his highest percentage of the season. 
                We should expect this kind of usage moving forward making him 
                a low-end RB1.

WithJavonte Williamsinactive,Jaleel McLaughlin(33.3%) andSamaje Perine(60.3%) split the RB work. McLaughlin had 12 touches 
                to Perine’s 10. Both should be owned and can be deployed 
                as a Flex with McLaughlin being the preferred option.

Marvin Mims(31.7%) continues to play behindBrandon Johnson(50.8%) in the Broncos third WR spot.



DAL @ SF

The Cowboys got blasted by the 49ers and couldn’t move 
                the ball on offense. Nothing to see here.

Elijah Mitchellwas inactive leading toJordan Mason(18.3%) 
                filling the backup RB role behindChristian McCaffrey(73.2%).

Brandon Aiyuk(78.9%) saw a 28.0% target share whileDeebo Samuel(73.2%) is playing through multiple injuries.

Tight End week saw three TDs fromGeorge Kittle(78.9%) on 4 
                targets.



GB @ LV

Reportedly,Aaron Joneswas set to be a big part of the gameplan 
                but he was Inactive due to a hamstring injury.AJ Dillon(63.8%) 
                shared RB duties withPatrick Taylor(36.2%) with Dillon seeing 
                20 carries for 76 yds and 1 TD. Taylor had 4 touches.

Christian Watson(84.5%) was back in a full-time role after being 
                limited last week with a hamstring injury.Romeo Doubs(86.2%) 
                was the only other Packers’ receiver to play more than 22% 
                of the snaps.

Another day at the inefficient office forJosh Jacobs(84.4%). 
                Dude’s getting all the work though with 25 touches in this 
                game. He’s averaging 2.9 yards per carry this season.

Davante Adams(93.8%) andJakobi Meyers(95.3%) continue to dominant 
                the receiving work for Las Vegas.

Article Content:
DEN @ KC

Offensive SnapsBroncos: 52Chiefs: 71Isiah Pacheco’s 22 touches came on a 63.4% snap share which 
                is his highest snap share of the season.Jerick McKinnon(26.8%) 
                andClyde Edwards-Helaire(12.7%) are still involved which cap 
                Pacheco’s upside.The Chiefs WR by committee saw a bit of a change this week asRashee Ricesaw a 49.3% snap share, his highest mark of the season. 
                This should be sticky as he’s the only Chiefs wideout that 
                shown some promise through the early part of the season.Travis Kelceplayed 69.0% of the snaps on his injured ankle and 
                posted his best yardage game of the season (9-124-0).The Broncos gaveJavonte 
                Williams(34.6%) and rookieJaleel 
                McLaughlin(40.4%) the bulk of the running back work at the 
                expense ofSamaje 
                Perine(17.3%). Perine was still active in the two-minute 
                drill and passing game which is unfortunate. Williams and McLaughlin 
                are the backs to own moving forward.Courtland Sutton(94.2%) has solidified himself as the No.1 WR 
                on the Broncos while trade rumors surroundJerry Jeudy(65.4%).Marvin Mims(23.1%) continues to be hidden in background along 
                withBrandon Johnson(30.8%) and Lil'Jordan Humphrey (28.8%).TEGreg Dulcich(21.2%) finally got back on the field and promptly 
                left with…. you guessed it… a hamstring injury.BAL @ TENOffensive SnapsRavens: 71Titans: 55Gus Edwards(62.0%) was in the lead back role overJustice Hill(38.0%) in Week 6 and out-touched Hill 17 to 11. Both hold marginal 
                Flex value withLamar Jacksonsoaking up 10 rushing opportunities 
                on a weekly basis.Zay Flowers(88.7%) continues to be the only fantasy wide receiver option 
                in Baltimore.Nelson 
                Agholor(52.1%),Rashod 
                Bateman(47.9%) andOdell 
                Beckham Jr.(40.8%) don’t see enough targets in this offense.It was almost and even split betweenDerrick Henry(52.7%) andTyjae Spears(56.4%). We’ve seen this throughout the season 
                especially in negative game scripts for Tennessee. Despite the 
                equal snap share, Henry continues to get more of the opportunities 
                (14 to 5).Nick Westbrook-Ikhine(70.9%) is on the field but onlyDeAndre Hopkins(87.3%) is worthy of fantasy rosters among the Tennessee 
                wide receivers.Treylon Burkswas inactive.WAS @ ATLOffensive SnapsCommanders: 51Falcons: 83Washington struggled to move the ball against the Falcons which 
                led to fewer opportunities forBrian Robinson Jr.(52.9%) andAntonio Gibson(39.2%). Their roles remain constant.Terry McLaurin(84.3%) saw a very high 52.4% target share whileJahan Dotson’s (80.4%) forgettable season continues. He 
                saw 1 target in this game and dropped it whileCurtis Samuel(62.7%) 
                caught all four of his targets for 42 yards and a TD.After 11 targets in Week 5, TELogan Thomas(78.4%) saw just 
                1 target in Week 6.Atlanta ran 83 plays which allowed QBDesmond Ridderto throw 
                47 times, by far the most attempts he’s had this season.Bijan Robinson(77.1%) was on the field far more thanTyler Allgeier(27.7%) but both had 13 carries. As expected, Bijan was active 
                in the passing game with 8 targets while Allgeier had none.Kyle Pitts(55.4%) found the endzone but is still sharing tight 
                end time withJonnu Smith(54.2%) who also found the endzone this 
                week.Drake London(81.9%) had a 27.3% target share. Newly acquiredVan Jeffersonplayed 26.5% of the snaps.SF @ CLEOffensive Snaps49ers: 62Browns: 76Christian 
                McCaffrey(58.1%) left this game with an oblique injury which 
                allowedJordan 
                Mason(24.2%) andElijah 
                Mitchell(11.3%) to see some extra carries. This was Mitchell’s 
                first game back since Week 3 so it’s a little unclear if he’ll 
                remain third on the depth chart. HC Kyle Shanahan loves him and 
                it wouldn't be surprising to see him have a bigger role in Week 
                7 if CMC sits. Mason will be a waiver wire add this week.Deebo Samuel(14.5%) has battled injuries early this season and 
                left this game with a shoulder issue.Jauan Jennings(53.2%) has 
                been the next man up in these scenarios whileRay-Ray McCloud(71.0%) probably isn’t going to be fantasy-worthy if Deebo 
                misses time.WithDeshaun Watson(shoulder) out, the Browns leaned on their 
                two running backsJerome Ford(50.0%) andKareem Hunt(36.8%) 
                who totaled 34 touches.No change in WR play for the Browns asAmari Cooper(84.2%),Elijah Moore(80.3%) andDonovan Peoples-Jones(80.3%) were in 
                their typical roles.NO @ HOUOffensive SnapsSaints: 82Texans: 63Alvin Kamara(80.5%) is operating like a workhorse back with 
                a 76% rush share and a 21.1% target share.Kendre Miller(22.0%) 
                had 3 touches.Rashid Shaheed(75.6%) is still operating as the third receiver 
                for the Saints behindChris Olave(87.8%) andMichael Thomas(82.9%) 
                but needs a big play to have any fantasy relevance.We sawTaysom Hill(59.8%) get a 21.1% target share this week, 
                by far the most work he’s seen in the passing game in his 
                career. Keep in mind the Saints ran 82 plays and Carr attempted 
                50 passes so Hill’s receiving work may not be sticky moving 
                forward.Dameon Pierce(33.3%) is losing playing time and opportunities 
                toDevin Singletary(54.0%). Both had 13 touches this week but 
                Pierce has been less efficient (2.9 yards per carry) all season. 
                Expect Singletary to have a significant role moving forward.Noah Brown(55.6%) was working as the third receiver withTank Dellinactive.John Metchie(25.4%) saw 2 targets.CAR @ MIAOffensive SnapsPanthers: 69Dolphins: 67WithMiles Sandersout, the Panthers used onlyChuba Hubbard(76.8%) andRaheem Blackshear(71.4%) at running back. Hubbard 
                out-touched Blackshear 20 to 6.Adam Thielen(81.2%) has been a league winner through six weeks. 
                He saw a 37.1% target share on Sunday. The Panthers are 0-6 and 
                HC Frank Reich is giving up play-calling duties.Jonathan Mingo(92.8%) andD.J. Chark(66.7%) are the only other 
                considerations in this offense.The beat goes on for the high-flying Dolphins.Raheem Mostert(61.2%),Salvon Ahmed(35.8%) andChris Brooks(16.4%) share RB 
                duties. Mostert scored three TDs on 20 touches and is now averaging 
                5.7 yards per carry.Speaking of high efficiency,Tyreek Hill(56.7%) is averaging 
                19.4 yards per reception. He left this game for awhile with cramps

The Chiefs WR by committee saw a bit of a change this week asRashee Ricesaw a 49.3% snap share, his highest mark of the season. 
                This should be sticky as he’s the only Chiefs wideout that 
                shown some promise through the early part of the season.

BAL @ TEN

Offensive SnapsRavens: 71Titans: 55

Gus Edwards(62.0%) was in the lead back role overJustice Hill(38.0%) in Week 6 and out-touched Hill 17 to 11. Both hold marginal 
                Flex value withLamar Jacksonsoaking up 10 rushing opportunities 
                on a weekly basis.

Zay Flowers(88.7%) continues to be the only fantasy wide receiver option 
                in Baltimore.Nelson 
                Agholor(52.1%),Rashod 
                Bateman(47.9%) andOdell 
                Beckham Jr.(40.8%) don’t see enough targets in this offense.

It was almost and even split betweenDerrick Henry(52.7%) andTyjae Spears(56.4%). We’ve seen this throughout the season 
                especially in negative game scripts for Tennessee. Despite the 
                equal snap share, Henry continues to get more of the opportunities 
                (14 to 5).

Nick Westbrook-Ikhine(70.9%) is on the field but onlyDeAndre Hopkins(87.3%) is worthy of fantasy rosters among the Tennessee 
                wide receivers.Treylon Burkswas inactive.



WAS @ ATL

Washington struggled to move the ball against the Falcons which 
                led to fewer opportunities forBrian Robinson Jr.(52.9%) andAntonio Gibson(39.2%). Their roles remain constant.

Terry McLaurin(84.3%) saw a very high 52.4% target share whileJahan Dotson’s (80.4%) forgettable season continues. He 
                saw 1 target in this game and dropped it whileCurtis Samuel(62.7%) 
                caught all four of his targets for 42 yards and a TD.

After 11 targets in Week 5, TELogan Thomas(78.4%) saw just 
                1 target in Week 6.

Atlanta ran 83 plays which allowed QBDesmond Ridderto throw 
                47 times, by far the most attempts he’s had this season.

Bijan Robinson(77.1%) was on the field far more thanTyler Allgeier(27.7%) but both had 13 carries. As expected, Bijan was active 
                in the passing game with 8 targets while Allgeier had none.

Kyle Pitts(55.4%) found the endzone but is still sharing tight 
                end time withJonnu Smith(54.2%) who also found the endzone this 
                week.

Drake London(81.9%) had a 27.3% target share. Newly acquiredVan Jeffersonplayed 26.5% of the snaps.

SF @ CLE

Christian 
                McCaffrey(58.1%) left this game with an oblique injury which 
                allowedJordan 
                Mason(24.2%) andElijah 
                Mitchell(11.3%) to see some extra carries. This was Mitchell’s 
                first game back since Week 3 so it’s a little unclear if he’ll 
                remain third on the depth chart. HC Kyle Shanahan loves him and 
                it wouldn't be surprising to see him have a bigger role in Week 
                7 if CMC sits. Mason will be a waiver wire add this week.

Deebo Samuel(14.5%) has battled injuries early this season and 
                left this game with a shoulder issue.Jauan Jennings(53.2%) has 
                been the next man up in these scenarios whileRay-Ray McCloud(71.0%) probably isn’t going to be fantasy-worthy if Deebo 
                misses time.

WithDeshaun Watson(shoulder) out, the Browns leaned on their 
                two running backsJerome Ford(50.0%) andKareem Hunt(36.8%) 
                who totaled 34 touches.

No change in WR play for the Browns asAmari Cooper(84.2%),Elijah Moore(80.3%) andDonovan Peoples-Jones(80.3%) were in 
                their typical roles.

NO @ HOU

Alvin Kamara(80.5%) is operating like a workhorse back with 
                a 76% rush share and a 21.1% target share.Kendre Miller(22.0%) 
                had 3 touches.

Rashid Shaheed(75.6%) is still operating as the third receiver 
                for the Saints behindChris Olave(87.8%) andMichael Thomas(82.9%) 
                but needs a big play to have any fantasy relevance.

We sawTaysom Hill(59.8%) get a 21.1% target share this week, 
                by far the most work he’s seen in the passing game in his 
                career. Keep in mind the Saints ran 82 plays and Carr attempted 
                50 passes so Hill’s receiving work may not be sticky moving 
                forward.

Dameon Pierce(33.3%) is losing playing time and opportunities 
                toDevin Singletary(54.0%). Both had 13 touches this week but 
                Pierce has been less efficient (2.9 yards per carry) all season. 
                Expect Singletary to have a significant role moving forward.

Noah Brown(55.6%) was working as the third receiver withTank Dellinactive.John Metchie(25.4%) saw 2 targets.



CAR @ MIA

WithMiles Sandersout, the Panthers used onlyChuba Hubbard(76.8%) andRaheem Blackshear(71.4%) at running back. Hubbard 
                out-touched Blackshear 20 to 6.

Adam Thielen(81.2%) has been a league winner through six weeks. 
                He saw a 37.1% target share on Sunday. The Panthers are 0-6 and 
                HC Frank Reich is giving up play-calling duties.

Jonathan Mingo(92.8%) andD.J. Chark(66.7%) are the only other 
                considerations in this offense.

The beat goes on for the high-flying Dolphins.Raheem Mostert(61.2%),Salvon Ahmed(35.8%) andChris Brooks(16.4%) share RB 
                duties. Mostert scored three TDs on 20 touches and is now averaging 
                5.7 yards per carry.

Speaking of high efficiency,Tyreek Hill(56.7%) is averaging 
                19.4 yards per reception. He left this game for awhile with cramps 
                but later returned.Jaylen Waddle(68.7%) has now scored in back-to=back 
                games but seems to be getting forced looks even when Hill is open.



SEA @ CIN

Kenneth Walker(75.7%) has a consistent workload but has yet 
                to top 100 rushing in a game this season.Zach Charbonnet(24.3%) 
                remains a good hold if you have the bench spot.

DK Metcalf(78.4%) continues to have diva moments on the field 
                whileJaxon Smith-Njigba(71.6%) had his highest output of the 
                season at just 48 yards (sigh).

Joe Mixon(70.4%) continues his inefficient ways but the Bengals 
                show no signs of reducing his role.

Tee Higgins(53.7%) didn’t see his normal amount of snaps 
                in his first game back with a rib injury.Trenton Irwin(44.4%) 
                filled the void.



IND @ JAX

Jonathan Taylorsaw his snap percentage increase to 42.3% this 
                week, still a little behindZack Moss(50.0%). Both RBs had 13 
                touches.

Alec Pierce(74.4%) left this game with a shoulder injury.Josh Downs(78.2%) has been more active in the passing game and should 
                continue to be the No.2 receiver in the Colts offense.

Travis Etienne(79.7%) continues to have a dominant RB role and 
                logged another 21 touches on Sunday.

We may seeTrevor Lawrencemiss Week 7 with a knee injury.Calvin Ridley(79.7%) had a 28.6% target share but had just 4 catches 
                for 30 yards.



MIN @ CHI

Alexander Mattison(78.9%) is still playing well-ahead ofCam Akers(15.8%).

In their first game withoutJustin Jefferson, the Vikings usedJordan Addison(86.0%) andK.J. Osborn(93.3%) as their top two 
                wideouts withBrandon Powell(59.6%) working as the 3rd receiver.

TET.J. Hockenson(78.9%) had the highest target share of the

                ahead ofDarrynton 
                Evans(36.4%). Expect Roshcon Johnson to get into the mix 
                ahead of Evans when he’s ready to return.

The Bears will likely be withoutJustin Fields(thumb) in Week 
                7.Tyler Scott(59.1%) filled the No.3 receiver role this week 
                but isn’t fantasy viable.



NE @ LV

We actually saw some efficiency from the Patriots running backs 
                this week asRhamondre Stevenson(65.0%) andEzekiel Elliott(38.3%) 
                both averaged over 4.6 yards per carry! Both are still uninspiring 
                Flex options.

JuJu Smith-Schuster(concussion) missed this game which allowedDeVante Parker(75.0%) andKendrick Bourne(93.3%) to see the 
                majority of snaps.Tyquan Thornton(41.7%) saw his first action 
                of the season but isn’t fantasy relevant. Bourne saw a 35.5% 
                target share and is the WR to own.

Nobody creates a 3-yard dust cloud likeJosh Jacobs(81.4%).

The concentration of passing volume onDavante Adams(91.4%) 
                andJakobi Meyers(91.4%) is actually quite amazing. However, 
                keep your eye on rookie TEMichael Mayer(81.4%) who is starting 
                to make his presence known in this offense. He has 114 yards over 
                the last two weeks.



DET @ TB

The Lions lostDavid Montgomery(25.7%) early in this game with 
                a rib injury and will likely roll withCraig Reynolds(61.4%) 
                ifJahmyr Gibbs(hamstring) continues to miss.

Amon-Ra St. Brown(91.4%) returned to his normal role after a 
                one-game absence and promptly saw 15 targets.

Ke'Shawn 
                Vaughn(21.4%) has taken over the No.2 running back role in 
                Tampa Bay behindRachaad 
                White(78.6%) but he has little fantasy value in this offense.

Mike Evans(80.4%) was not limited in his return from a hamstring 
                injury.Trey Palmer(66.1%) operated as the third wideout.



ARI @ LAR

The Cardinals used three running backs withJames Connerout.Keaontay Ingram(36.8%)Emari Demercado(43.4%) andDamien Williams(17.1%). Interestingly, Demercado only had 3 touches while Ingram 
                had the highest rush share (33.3%). Williams had 9 touches. All 
                of these backs will peak at Flex value until Arizona decides to 
                eliminate one from the mix.

WRRondale Moore(65.8%) did not see any extra work at RB with Conner out.

TETrey McBride(57.9%) had an equal target share toZach Ertz(46.1%) as both saw five targets.

The Rams barely ran the ball in the first half, then flipped 
                the switch onKyren Williams(82.5%) who rolled up 158 rushing 
                yards on 20 carries. Keep an eye on Williams who suffered an ankle 
                injury and backupRonnie Rivers(7.0%) suffered a knee injury.Zach Evanswould be the next man up.

BothCooper Kupp(100%) andPuka Nacua(96.5%) saw a high target 
                share (15 combined targets on 24 attempts from Stafford) which 
                leaves very little forTutu Atwell(87.7%) or TETyler Higbee(94.7%).



PHI @ NYJ

Boston Scott(7.1%) saw a few offensive snaps this week but mainlyD’Andre 
                Swift(57.1%) andKenneth 
                Gainwell(41.4%) continued in their normal roles. Swift saw 
                10 targets (8-40-1) which helped considered he only rushed for 
                18 yards against the tough Jets-D.

Olamide Zaccheaus(81.4%) filled in forQuez Watkinsbut quickly 
                found out the targets go toA.J. Brown(95.7%) andDeVonta Smith(98.6%) in this offense.

The Jets are still using three running backs but at least their 
                givingBreece Hall(66.2%) the majority of carries (57.1% rush 
                share). Hall got a gift TD at the end of the game as the Eagles 
                let him score from 8-yards out.

TETyler Conklin(70.8%) has solidified himself as the pass-catching 
                tight end in this offense.C.J. Uzomahplayed 36.9% of the snaps.



NYG @ BUF

Saquon Barkley(77.9%) returned to action and was not limited 
                by any means. He had 28 touches as the Giants tried to move the 
                ball on the ground withTyrod Taylorat quarterback.Matt Breida(23.4%) only played 18 snaps.

Jalin Hyattsaw his highest snap share of the season at 72.7% but only had 
                4 targets.Darius 
                Slayton(87.0%) andWan'Dale 
                Robinson(59.7%) round out the top three receivers. Robinson 
                has some marginal value in PPR leauges.

Latavius Murray(49.2%) played the same number of snaps asJames Cook(49.2%) as Murray had some success early running up the middle.Damien Harrisleft early with a scary neck injury.

Stefon Diggs(93.4%) andGabriel Davis(88.5%) continue to pace 
                the Bills receivers in snap percentage. Tight endDalton Kincaidwas inactive which allowedDawson Knoxto play 75.4% of the snaps.

DAL @ LAC

Offensive SnapsCowboys: 64Chargers: 73

Deuce Vaughnwas a healthy scratch for Dallas.Tony Pollard(79.7%) 
                is still in a bellcow role. He saw 21 touches including 6 receptions 
                and totaled 110 yards. He hasn’t scored since Week 1.

Michael Gallup(70.3%) was targeted 10 times in this game (33.3% 
                target share) but only caught 3 passes for 24 yards, just missing 
                on a few big plays.

TEJake Ferguson(85.9%) only had 1 target as the gameplan focused 
                on the wideouts and attacking CBMichael Davis.

Austin Ekeler(68.5%) saw 18 touches in his return from an ankle 
                injury whileJoshua Kelley(27.4%) played the backup role.

Josh Palmer(97.3%) had a 19.4% target share and had three catches 
                called back due to a penalty. One was a TD.Keenan Allenhad a 
                30.6% target share and delivered 7-85-1.

Article Content:
JAX @ NO

Offensive SnapsJaguars: 56Saints: 90The Jaguars got a defensive TD in this game which tends to limit 
                snaps for the offense.RBTank Bigsby(14.3%) continues to be an afterthought. He had just two touches 
                in this game.Al Michaels noted early in the broadcast that the Jags coaches 
                thoughtChristian Kirk(80.4%) could have a big game out of the 
                slot. He caught 6 of six targets for 90 yards and a TD whileCalvin Ridley(87.5%) was a ghost finishing with a 1-5-0 line on four 
                targets.Jamal Agnew(51.8%) was working as the third receiver withZay Jonesinactive.The Saints offense continues to struggle with timing and looks 
                out of sync withDerek Carrat quarterback. It’s good news 
                forAlvin Kamara(73.3%), especially in PPR leagues, as the checkdown 
                is being used at a high rate. This was Kamara’s second game 
                with 14 targets!Jamaal Williams(22.2%) returned to action which sentKendre Miller’s (3.3%) value plummeting. Miller can be released 
                unless you have a deep bench.This is the second-straight week that TETaysom Hill(57.8%) 
                was being used like a tight end in the passing game. He now has 
                13 targets and 11-99-0 in the last two weeks. His 4-50-0 through 
                the air and 5-18-1 on the ground should easily make him a top 
                10 TE this week.CLE @ INDOffensive SnapsBrowns: 75Colts: 70Jerome Ford(42.7%) left in the 4th quarter with an ankle injury 
                which allowedKareem Hunt(25.3%) andPierre Strong Jr.(30.7%) 
                some extra work. There two would likely split time if Ford were 
                to miss Week 8 with Hunt being the preferred option given his 
                goaline role.Amari Cooperplayed 88.0% of the snaps and had a 22.9% target 
                share but caught only 2 passes asDeshaun Watson(16.0%) left 
                this game early after being checked for a concussion. Watson was 
                cleared but HC Kevin Stefanski opted to go withP.J. Walkeras 
                Watson came into the game with a shoulder injury.TEDavid Njokuplayed 96.0% of the snaps and had a 25.7% target 
                share, his highest target share of the season.We’ve seenJonathan Taylor’s snap share increase 
                the last two weeks, but he split time evenly this week withZack Moss. Both played 50% of the snaps. The new normal? Taylor had 
                24 opportunities while Moss had 22.Alec Pierceplayed 100.0% of the snaps but is clearly the WR3 
                in this offense behindMichael Pittman Jr.(97.1%) andJosh Downs(71.4%). Downs has 22 more targets than Pierce for the season.BUF @ NEOffensive SnapsBills: 71Patriots: 60WithDamien Harrisout, the Bills stuck with a two-man running 
                back committee.James Cook(52.1%) out-touchedLatavius Murray(45.1%) 16 to 6.The Bills continue to rotate their third-receiver role makingKhalil Shakir(33.8%),Deonte Harty(26.8%) andTrent Sherfield(22.5%) unplayable.The Bills liked the matchup with TEDalton Kincaid(60.6%) this 
                week as he saw a 20.5% target share while fellow TEDawson Knox(63.4%) had just a 7.7% target share.The Patriots continue to give all of their running back touches 
                toRhamondre Stevenson(65.0%) andEzekiel Elliott(35.0%). Rhamondre 
                had 15 opportunities while Zeke had 11.Kendrick Bourne(93.3%) is operating as the Patriots No.1 wideout 
                with a 23.3% target share this week.Demario Douglas(61.7%),DeVante Parker(58.3%) andJalen Reagor(41.7%) were on the field 
                but not fantasy worthy.JuJu Smith-Schuster(concussion) was Inactive.LV @ CHIOffensive SnapsRaiders: 65Bears: 71We saw increase playing time forZamir White(21.5%) who had 
                just 5 touches.Josh Jacobs(66.2%) continues to be inefficient, 
                sporting 2.9 yards per carry this season.WRTre Tucker(49.2%) is seeing significant action at the expense 
                ofHunter Renfrow(36.9%) but neither are fantasy worthy behindDavante Adams(75.4%) andJakobi Meyers(93.8%).Michael Mayerplayed 70.8% of the snaps, well ahead ofAustin Hooper(33.8%).D’Onta Foreman’s 
                monster game (16-89-2, 3-31-1) happened on just 46.5% of the snaps 
                as he split time withDarrynton 
                Evans(47.9%).Travis 
                Homerwas active but only played 3 snaps. Evans saw 15 touches 
                as the Bears torched the Raiders 30 to 12.WAS @ NYGOffensive SnapsCommanders: 69Giants: 68The Commanders have givenChris Rodriguez Jr.(13.0%) more opportunities 
                the last two weeks which cuts into the fantasy value ofBrian Robinson Jr.(49.3%) andAntonio Gibson(37.7%). Not great.Terry McLaurin(88.4%),Jahan Dotson(84.1%) andCurtis Samuel(55.1%) all saw a target share above 22.2% this week. Dotson’s 
                43 yards was his highest yardage output of the season.Saquon Barkley(83.8%) is one of the few workhorse backs in the 
                league. He’s had 24 and 28 touches the last two weeks.The Giants WR group seems stable at the moment withDarius 
                Slayton(83.8%),Jalin 
                Hyatt(70.6%) andWan’Dale 
                Robinson(60.3%) but lacks real fantasy value.TEDarren Waller(82.4%) had his best game of the season and 
                led all Giants pass catches with a 29.6% target share.ATL @ TBOffensive SnapsFalcons: 65Buccaneers: 73Bijan Robinson(16.9%) played just 11 snaps as it was revealed after the game 
                that he was suffering from a bad headache that started Saturday 
                night. He went through warmups but still didn’t feel right and 
                HC Arthur Smith decided to roll withTyler 
                Allgeier(50.8%) andCordarrelle 
                Patterson(40.0%) and running back. Yikes. Bijan had 1 carry 
                late in the game and says that he will be ready for Week 8.Van Jefferson(49.2%) is seeing his playing time increase butDrake London(84.6%) is the only WR that is fantasy viable in 
                this offense.Kyle Pitts(52.3%) andJonnu Smith(53.8%) continue to split 
                time as both remain on the high-end TE2 radar.Rachaad White(75.3%) is a volume-based RB2 who catches passes 
                but lacks any real upside. He has just 1 TD on the season.Trey Palmer(64.4%) continues to operate as Tampa’s No.3 
                receiver but isn’t getting enough looks to be counted on 
                in starting lineups.DET @ BALOffensive SnapsLions: 75Ravens: 60Dan Campbell mentioned early in the week thatJahmyr 
                Gibbswas going to get a lot of work and he did (11-68-1, 
                9-58-0). Gibbs played on 86.7% of the snaps and demonstrated why 
                he can be RB1 as he received 10 targets in the passing game as 
                the Lions played from behind.Craig 
                Reynolds(9.3%) was barely used.The early deficit was huge forAmon-Ra St. Brown(97.3%) who 
                saw a 38.8% target share.Jameson Williamsplayed 44.0% of the 
                snaps asKalif Raymond(36.0%) left with a hamstring injury.Gus EdwardsandJustice Hillboth played 50.0% of the snaps. 
                With Ravens playing from ahead, Edwards out-touched Hill 15 to 
                5.Zay Flowers(71.7%) played the most of any Ravens receiver butOdell Beckham Jr.(56.7%) had the highest target share at 25.0%.Rashod Bateman(48.3%) andNelson Agholor(36.7%) were also in 
                the mix.ARI @ SEAOffensive SnapsCardinals: 66Seahawks: 60Emari Demercadowas the lead back for the Cardinals and played 
                on 80.3% of the snaps whileKeaontay Ingram(0.0%) was strictly 
                used on special teams.Damien Williams(18.2%) only had 1 carry. 
                We don’t know if Demercado’s lead back status is sticky 
                given he only had 3 touches in Week 6. Stay tuned…The Cardinals are using a tight wide receiver group withMarquise Brown(82.4%),Michael Wilson(83.3%) andRondale Moore(66.7%) 
                but have a subpar quarterback isn’t helping their value. 
                Brown had a 21.2% target share.Zach ErtzandTrey McBrideboth played 53.0% of the snaps.Zach Charbonnetwas inactive for Seattle which allowedKenneth Walkerto play 80.0% of the snaps.DeeJay Dallasplayed 23.3% 
                but had just 1 touch.DK Metcalfwas Inactive so the Seahawks basically playedJake 
                Bobo(75.0%) in his position. Bobo saw a 20.8% target share 
                as didTyler 
                LockettwhileJaxon 
                Smith-Njigba(63.3%) saw a 29.2% target share. Bobo will be 
                a fantasy consideration whenever Metcalf is out.PIT @ LAROffensive SnapsSteelers: 59Rams: 68Najee Harris(57.6%) has seen exactly 14 carries in his last 
                three games. He finally found the endzone for the first time this 
                year as didJaylen Warren(45.8%) on 7 touches.Diontae Johnson(66.1%) played for the first time since injuring 
                his hamstring in Week 1 and had a 26.1% target share.George Pickens(89.8%) led the team with a 34.8% target share.With TEPat Freiermuthout,Darnell Washington(52.5%) andConnor Heyward(86.4%) shared tight end duties and don’t have any 
                fantasy value.We got word late in the week thatZach Evanswasn’t going 
                to be a thing at running back for the Rams. Instead,Darrell Henderson(57.4%) andRoyce Freeman(42.6%) split the duties with Henderson 
                handling 20 opportunities and Freeman 12. Henderson is the preferred 
                option here for the time being.The Rams are locked in with their top three receivers:Cooper Kupp(100%),Puka Nacua(92.6%) andTutu Atwell(73.5%).GB @ DENOffensive SnapsPackers: 64Broncos: 59It’s been seven weeks and we’ve yet to get a full 
                game fromAaron Jones. He was once again limited due to his hamstring 
                injury, playing just 35.9% of the snaps and getting out-touched 
                byAJ Dillon(56.2%) 17 to 11. Jones has been one of the big disappointments 
                of the fantasy season.Jayden Reed(48.4%) played well behindChristian Watson(87.5%) 
                andRomeo Doubs(81.2%).TELuke Musgraveplayed just 67.2% of the snaps as he left after 
                a big hit from Broncos DBKareem Jackson.The Broncos three-headed RBBC is a nightmare.Javonte Williams(52.5%),Samaje Perine(25.4%) andJaleel McLaughlin(16.9%) are 
                difficult to trust in any given week. Williams is the lead RB 
                of the group but he comes with high risk.Marvin Mimsplayed 30.5% of the snaps behindBrandon Johnson(37.3%) and had just 1 targetLAC @ KCOffensive SnapsChargers: 63Chiefs: 68Austin Ekeler(63.5%) spent some time on the sidelines in the first half with 
                an injury but later returned. While he has out,Joshua 
                Kelley(36.5%) busted off a 49-yard TD run. Ekeler’s had two 
                subpar performances since returning in Week 6.RookieQuentin Johnston(54.0%) had just a 6.7% target share 
                as the offense continues to run throughKeenan Allen(93.7%) andJosh Palmer(98.4%) at wideout.Isiah Pacheco(52.9%) got there, but it took a while. His first 
                every TD reception came late in the fourth quarter. He has 10 
                targets in the last two games.The Chiefs addedMecole 
                Hardman(16.2%) to the six-WR rotation this week.Marquez 
                Valdes-Scantling(69.1%),Rashee 
                Rice(58.8%) andSkyy 
                Moore(60.3%) are out there the most, but Rice seems to be 
                the wideout with the most fantasy juice.Kadarius 
                Toney(19.1%) had 1 target.MIA @ PHIOffensive SnapsDolphins: 49Eagles: 72Jeff Wilson(14.3%) returned to action this week and didn’t 
                see a carry. He had 1 target, playing behindRaheem Mostert(53.1%) 
                andSalvon Ahmed(36.7%).Jaylen Waddle(44.9%) left with a back issue then later returned. 
                It seems he’ll be fine moving forward.Cedrick WilsonandBraxton Berriosboth played 59.2% of the snaps.The Eagles running back tandem is stable withD’Andre 
                Swift(68.1%) andKenneth 
                Gainwell(31.9%) filling their typical roles.Boston 
                Scottdidn’t play an offensive snap.Julio Jonesplayed 22.2 of the snaps. He won’t be fantasy 
                viable unless an injury occurs toA.J. BrownorDeVonta Smith.SF @ MINOffensive Snaps49ers: 53Vikings: 70Christian McCaffreyplayed every snap for the 49ers.Elijah Mitchell(7.5%) appeared to be the backup whileJordan Masondidn’t 
                play a snap on offense.WithDeebo Samuelout,Jauan Jennings(73.6%) stepped into a 
                starting role and saw a 31.0% target share, the highest of all 
                49ers’ receivers.Ray-Ray McCloud(35.8%) filled the third 
                receiver role behindBrandon Aiyuk(98.1%).TEGeorge Kittleplayed 96.2% of the snaps and saw a 24.1% target 
                share.Cam Akers(38.6%) saw an increase in usage this week which could 
                be a sign of things to come. Akers had 13 opportunities whileAlexander Mattison(52.9%) had 11.Jordan Addison(74.3%) left the game for a bit with cramps but 
                did return to add two more catches to his total (7-123-2). He’s 
                the clear No.1 option at WR for the Vikings withJustin Jeffersonout.K.J. Osbornplayed 92.9% of the snaps and should be rostered.TET.J. Hockenson(84.3%) is the No.2 receiving option and saw 
                a 27.9% target share.Please enable JavaScript to view thecomments powered by Disqus.

The Jaguars got a defensive TD in this game which tends to limit 
                snaps for the offense.RBTank Bigsby(14.3%) continues to be an afterthought. He had just two touches 
                in this game.

Al Michaels noted early in the broadcast that the Jags coaches 
                thoughtChristian Kirk(80.4%) could have a big game out of the 
                slot. He caught 6 of six targets for 90 yards and a TD whileCalvin Ridley(87.5%) was a ghost finishing with a 1-5-0 line on four 
                targets.

Jamal Agnew(51.8%) was working as the third receiver withZay Jonesinactive.

The Saints offense continues to struggle with timing and looks 
                out of sync withDerek Carrat quarterback. It’s good news 
                forAlvin Kamara(73.3%), especially in PPR leagues, as the checkdown 
                is being used at a high rate. This was Kamara’s second game 
                with 14 targets!

Jamaal Williams(22.2%) returned to action which sentKendre Miller’s (3.3%) value plummeting. Miller can be released 
                unless you have a deep bench.

This is the second-straight week that TETaysom Hill(57.8%) 
                was being used like a tight end in the passing game. He now has 
                13 targets and 11-99-0 in the last two weeks. His 4-50-0 through 
                the air and 5-18-1 on the ground should easily make him a top 
                10 TE this week.



CLE @ IND

Offensive SnapsBrowns: 75Colts: 70

Jerome Ford(42.7%) left in the 4th quarter with an ankle injury 
                which allowedKareem Hunt(25.3%) andPierre Strong Jr.(30.7%) 
                some extra work. There two would likely split time if Ford were 
                to miss Week 8 with Hunt being the preferred option given his 
                goaline role.

Amari Cooperplayed 88.0% of the snaps and had a 22.9% target 
                share but caught only 2 passes asDeshaun Watson(16.0%) left 
                this game early after being checked for a concussion. Watson was 
                cleared but HC Kevin Stefanski opted to go withP.J. Walkeras 
                Watson came into the game with a shoulder injury.

TEDavid Njokuplayed 96.0% of the snaps and had a 25.7% target 
                share, his highest target share of the season.

We’ve seenJonathan Taylor’s snap share increase 
                the last two weeks, but he split time evenly this week withZack Moss. Both played 50% of the snaps. The new normal? Taylor had 
                24 opportunities while Moss had 22.

Alec Pierceplayed 100.0% of the snaps but is clearly the WR3 
                in this offense behindMichael Pittman Jr.(97.1%) andJosh Downs(71.4%). Downs has 22 more targets than Pierce for the season.



BUF @ NE

WithDamien Harrisout, the Bills stuck with a two-man running 
                back committee.James Cook(52.1%) out-touchedLatavius Murray(45.1%) 16 to 6.

The Bills continue to rotate their third-receiver role makingKhalil Shakir(33.8%),Deonte Harty(26.8%) andTrent Sherfield(22.5%) unplayable.

The Bills liked the matchup with TEDalton Kincaid(60.6%) this 
                week as he saw a 20.5% target share while fellow TEDawson Knox(63.4%) had just a 7.7% target share.

The Patriots continue to give all of their running back touches 
                toRhamondre Stevenson(65.0%) andEzekiel Elliott(35.0%). Rhamondre 
                had 15 opportunities while Zeke had 11.

Kendrick Bourne(93.3%) is operating as the Patriots No.1 wideout 
                with a 23.3% target share this week.Demario Douglas(61.7%),DeVante Parker(58.3%) andJalen Reagor(41.7%) were on the field 
                but not fantasy worthy.JuJu Smith-Schuster(concussion) was Inactive.



LV @ CHI

We saw increase playing time forZamir White(21.5%) who had 
                just 5 touches.Josh Jacobs(66.2%) continues to be inefficient, 
                sporting 2.9 yards per carry this season.

WRTre Tucker(49.2%) is seeing significant action at the expense 
                ofHunter Renfrow(36.9%) but neither are fantasy worthy behindDavante Adams(75.4%) andJakobi Meyers(93.8%).

Michael Mayerplayed 70.8% of the snaps, well ahead ofAustin Hooper(33.8%).

D’Onta Foreman’s 
                monster game (16-89-2, 3-31-1) happened on just 46.5% of the snaps 
                as he split time withDarrynton 
                Evans(47.9%).Travis 
                Homerwas active but only played 3 snaps. Evans saw 15 touches 
                as the Bears torched the Raiders 30 to 12.



WAS @ NYG

The Commanders have givenChris Rodriguez Jr.(13.0%) more opportunities 
                the last two weeks which cuts into the fantasy value ofBrian Robinson Jr.(49.3%) andAntonio Gibson(37.7%). Not great.

Terry McLaurin(88.4%),Jahan Dotson(84.1%) andCurtis Samuel(55.1%) all saw a target share above 22.2% this week. Dotson’s 
                43 yards was his highest yardage output of the season.

Saquon Barkley(83.8%) is one of the few workhorse backs in the 
                league. He’s had 24 and 28 touches the last two weeks.

The Giants WR group seems stable at the moment withDarius 
                Slayton(83.8%),Jalin 
                Hyatt(70.6%) andWan’Dale 
                Robinson(60.3%) but lacks real fantasy value.

TEDarren Waller(82.4%) had his best game of the season and 
                led all Giants pass catches with a 29.6% target share.



ATL @ TB

Bijan Robinson(16.9%) played just 11 snaps as it was revealed after the game 
                that he was suffering from a bad headache that started Saturday 
                night. He went through warmups but still didn’t feel right and 
                HC Arthur Smith decided to roll withTyler 
                Allgeier(50.8%) andCordarrelle 
                Patterson(40.0%) and running back. Yikes. Bijan had 1 carry 
                late in the game and says that he will be ready for Week 8.

Van Jefferson(49.2%) is seeing his playing time increase butDrake London(84.6%) is the only WR that is fantasy viable in 
                this offense.

Kyle Pitts(52.3%) andJonnu Smith(53.8%) continue to split 
                time as both remain on the high-end TE2 radar.

Rachaad White(75.3%) is a volume-based RB2 who catches passes 
                but lacks any real upside. He has just 1 TD on the season.

Trey Palmer(64.4%) continues to operate as Tampa’s No.3 
                receiver but isn’t getting enough looks to be counted on 
                in starting lineups.



DET @ BAL

Dan Campbell mentioned early in the week thatJahmyr 
                Gibbswas going to get a lot of work and he did (11-68-1, 
                9-58-0). Gibbs played on 86.7% of the snaps and demonstrated why 
                he can be RB1 as he received 10 targets in the passing game as 
                the Lions played from behind.Craig 
                Reynolds(9.3%) was barely used.

The early deficit was huge forAmon-Ra St. Brown(97.3%) who 
                saw a 38.8% target share.Jameson Williamsplayed 44.0% of the 
                snaps asKalif Raymond(36.0%) left with a hamstring injury.

Gus EdwardsandJustice Hillboth played 50.0% of the snaps. 
                With Ravens playing from ahead, Edwards out-touched Hill 15 to 
                5.

Zay Flowers(71.7%) played the most of any Ravens receiver butOdell Beckham Jr.(56.7%) had the highest target share at 25.0%.Rashod Bateman(48.3%) andNelson Agholor(36.7%) were also in 
                the mix.



ARI @ SEA

Emari Demercadowas the lead back for the Cardinals and played 
                on 80.3% of the snaps whileKeaontay Ingram(0.0%) was strictly 
                used on special teams.Damien Williams(18.2%) only had 1 carry. 
                We don’t know if Demercado’s lead back status is sticky 
                given he only had 3 touches in Week 6. Stay tuned…

The Cardinals are using a tight wide receiver group withMarquise Brown(82.4%),Michael Wilson(83.3%) andRondale Moore(66.7%) 
                but have a subpar quarterback isn’t helping their value. 
                Brown had a 21.2% target share.

Zach ErtzandTrey McBrideboth played 53.0% of the snaps.

Zach Charbonnetwas inactive for Seattle which allowedKenneth Walkerto play 80.0% of the snaps.DeeJay Dallasplayed 23.3% 
                but had just 1 touch.

DK Metcalfwas Inactive so the Seahawks basically playedJake 
                Bobo(75.0%) in his position. Bobo saw a 20.8% target share 
                as didTyler 
                LockettwhileJaxon 
                Smith-Njigba(63.3%) saw a 29.2% target share. Bobo will be 
                a fantasy consideration whenever Metcalf is out.



PIT @ LAR

Najee Harris(57.6%) has seen exactly 14 carries in his last 
                three games. He finally found the endzone for the first time this 
                year as didJaylen Warren(45.8%) on 7 touches.

Diontae Johnson(66.1%) played for the first time since injuring 
                his hamstring in Week 1 and had a 26.1% target share.George Pickens(89.8%) led the team with a 34.8% target share.

With TEPat Freiermuthout,Darnell Washington(52.5%) andConnor Heyward(86.4%) shared tight end duties and don’t have any 
                fantasy value.

We got word late in the week thatZach Evanswasn’t going 
                to be a thing at running back for the Rams. Instead,Darrell Henderson(57.4%) andRoyce Freeman(42.6%) split the duties with Henderson 
                handling 20 opportunities and Freeman 12. Henderson is the preferred 
                option here for the time being.

The Rams are locked in with their top three receivers:Cooper Kupp(100%),Puka Nacua(92.6%) andTutu Atwell(73.5%).



GB @ DEN

It’s been seven weeks and we’ve yet to get a full 
                game fromAaron Jones. He was once again limited due to his hamstring 
                injury, playing just 35.9% of the snaps and getting out-touched 
                byAJ Dillon(56.2%) 17 to 11. Jones has been one of the big disappointments 
                of the fantasy season.

Jayden Reed(48.4%) played well behindChristian Watson(87.5%) 
                andRomeo Doubs(81.2%).

TELuke Musgraveplayed just 67.2% of the snaps as he left after 
                a big hit from Broncos DBKareem Jackson.

The Broncos three-headed RBBC is a nightmare.Javonte Williams(52.5%),Samaje Perine(25.4%) andJaleel McLaughlin(16.9%) are 
                difficult to trust in any given week. Williams is the lead RB 
                of the group but he comes with high risk.

Marvin Mimsplayed 30.5% of the snaps behindBrandon Johnson(37.3%) and had just 1 target



LAC @ KC

Austin Ekeler(63.5%) spent some time on the sidelines in the first half with 
                an injury but later returned. While he has out,Joshua 
                Kelley(36.5%) busted off a 49-yard TD run. Ekeler’s had two 
                subpar performances since returning in Week 6.

RookieQuentin Johnston(54.0%) had just a 6.7% target share 
                as the offense continues to run throughKeenan Allen(93.7%) andJosh Palmer(98.4%) at wideout.

Isiah Pacheco(52.9%) got there, but it took a while. His first 
                every TD reception came late in the fourth quarter. He has 10 
                targets in the last two games.

The Chiefs addedMecole 
                Hardman(16.2%) to the six-WR rotation this week.Marquez 
                Valdes-Scantling(69.1%),Rashee 
                Rice(58.8%) andSkyy 
                Moore(60.3%) are out there the most, but Rice seems to be 
                the wideout with the most fantasy juice.Kadarius 
                Toney(19.1%) had 1 target.



MIA @ PHI

Jeff Wilson(14.3%) returned to action this week and didn’t 
                see a carry. He had 1 target, playing behindRaheem Mostert(53.1%) 
                andSalvon Ahmed(36.7%).

Jaylen Waddle(44.9%) left with a back issue then later returned. 
                It seems he’ll be fine moving forward.Cedrick WilsonandBraxton Berriosboth played 59.2% of the snaps.

The Eagles running back tandem is stable withD’Andre 
                Swift(68.1%) andKenneth 
                Gainwell(31.9%) filling their typical roles.Boston 
                Scottdidn’t play an offensive snap.

Julio Jonesplayed 22.2 of the snaps. He won’t be fantasy 
                viable unless an injury occurs toA.J. BrownorDeVonta Smith.



SF @ MIN

Christian McCaffreyplayed every snap for the 49ers.Elijah Mitchell(7.5%) appeared to be the backup whileJordan Masondidn’t 
                play a snap on offense.

WithDeebo Samuelout,Jauan Jennings(73.6%) stepped into a 
                starting role and saw a 31.0% target share, the highest of all 
                49ers’ receivers.Ray-Ray McCloud(35.8%) filled the third 
                receiver role behindBrandon Aiyuk(98.1%).

TEGeorge Kittleplayed 96.2% of the snaps and saw a 24.1% target 
                share.

Cam Akers(38.6%) saw an increase in usage this week which could 
                be a sign of things to come. Akers had 13 opportunities whileAlexander Mattison(52.9%) had 11.

Jordan Addison(74.3%) left the game for a bit with cramps but 
                did return to add two more catches to his total (7-123-2). He’s 
                the clear No.1 option at WR for the Vikings withJustin Jeffersonout.K.J. Osbornplayed 92.9% of the snaps and should be rostered.

TET.J. Hockenson(84.3%) is the No.2 receiving option and saw 
                a 27.9% target share.

Article Content:
TB @ BUF

Offensive SnapsBuccaneers: 69Bills: 68The Bucs aren’t a running team butRachaad White(82.4%) 
                is maintaining his RB2 value through receptions and play volume. 
                He has at least three catches in every game but one this season. 
                He had a 17.9% target share in Week 8.Trey Palmerhas solidified himself as the No.3 wideout playing 
                80.9% of the snaps against the Bills alongsideMike Evans(85.3%) 
                andChris Godwin(85.3%).James Cook(66.7%) andLatavius Murray(33.3%) continue to operate 
                as the one-two bunch in the backfield for the Bills. Cook had 
                15 touches to Murray’s 6.Khalil Shakir(65.2%) was the beneficiary of the Bills using 
                a lot of 11 personnel in this game.Trent Sherfield(31.9%) was 
                the 4th wideout whileDeonte Hartyplayed only 6 snaps.WithDawson Knoxout andQuintin 
                Morrisinactive,Dalton 
                Kincaidplayed 84.1% of the snaps and had his best game of 
                the season (5-65-1). Kincaid is a TE1 moving forward.JAX @ PITOffensive SnapsJaguars: 71Steelers: 67The dominant role forTravis Etienne(88.7%) continues. 30 opportunities 
                for him this week.Tank Bigsby(8.5%) played just 6 snaps.This was a better matchup forCalvin Ridley(85.9%) and he led 
                the wide receiver group with a 31.3% target share.TEEvan Engram(78.9%) also had a 31.3% target share.Status quo for the Steeler running back situation.Najee Harris(52.2%) andJaylen Warren(47.8%) are splitting time. Both saw 
                five targets.Diontae Johnson(91.0%) saw a huge 35.0% target share but only 
                caught 8 passes asKenny Pickett(41.8%) left this game with a 
                rib injury.TEConnor 
                Heyward(73.1%) - notDarnell 
                Washington(14.9%) - is filling the shoes forPat 
                Freiermuth.NYJ @ NYGOffensive SnapsJets: 64Giants: 75Dalvin Cook(12.5%) will continue to be unhappy about his playing 
                time as he plays behindBreece Hall(64.1%) andMichael Carter(23.4%).Randall Cobbwas inactive so the Jets rotatedMalik Taylor(35.9%) 
                andXavier Gipson(25.0%) through the No.3 spot behindGarrett Wilson(89.1%) andAllen Lazard(81.2%). Only Wilson is fantasy 
                viable.The Giants are a mess.Tyrod Taylor(33.3%) left with a rib injury 
                which allowedTommy DeVito(66.7%) to see some action. The two 
                QBs threw the ball a combined 14 times for 7… yes… 
                7 passing yards.Daniel Jones(neck) is expected back in Week 
                9.Because the passing game was inept,Saquon Barkley(89.3%) saw 
                41… yes… 41 opportunities including 36 carries.Matt Breida(10.7%) was the only other running back to see an offensive 
                snap.HOU @ CAROffensive SnapsTexans: 58Panthers: 67It looks like the Texans are going stick with their even split 
                betweenDameon Pierce(43.1%) andDevin Singletary(39.7%). Both 
                got 12 opportunities.Noah Brown(72.4%) filled the No.3 WR role withRobert Woodsinactive. He played behindNico Collins(72.4%) andTank Dell(77.6%). Dell had the lowest target share of the group at 16.7%.Coming out of the bye with a new play-caller,Chuba Hubbard(67.2%) 
                took over the lead RB role in Carolina, getting 17 opportunities 
                to just 2 for veteranMiles Sanders(17.9%).Raheem Blackshear(14.9%) got more touches than Sanders.Carolina had a tight WR rotation withAdam Thielen(97.0%),Jonathan Mingo(98.5%) andD.J. Chark(92.5%) basically playing the whole 
                game.TETommy Tremble(53.7%) played 36 snaps compared to 22 snaps 
                forHayden Hurst(32.8%).NE @ MIAOffensive SnapsPatriots: 53Dolphins: 77Rhamondre Stevenson(58.5%) anEzekiel Elliott(41.5%) continue 
                to split time in an uninspiring backfield.Kendrick Bourne(60.4%) tore his ACL and will miss the remainder 
                of the season. That may for force the Patriots to playJuJu Smith-Schuster(34.0%) more along withDemario Douglas(77.4%).DeVante Parker(43.4%) was also injured in this game. This is a situation to 
                avoid.Jeff Wilson(24.7%) andSalvon Ahmed(24.7%) split time evenly 
                behindRaheem Mostert(55.8%). This three-man committee is hurting 
                Mostert’s value. He has just 23 touches the last two games.BothTyreek Hill(75.3%) andJaylen Waddle(75.3%) had over 100 
                yards receiving and a TD in this game.Braxton Berrios(53.2%),Cedrick Wilson(29.9%) andChase Claypool(14.3%) also saw the 
                field.ATL @ TENOffensive SnapsFalcons: 68Titans: 68Desmond Ridder(45.6%) was pulled in this game for ineffectiveness? 
                Head coach Arthur Smith says “No” as Ridder was evaluated 
                for a concussion, cleared but didn’t return.Taylor Heinicke(54.4%) played the second half going 12-of-21 for 175 yards and 
                a touchdown.A week after theBijan Robinsonshenanigans, he played 73.5% 
                of the snaps against the Titans and saw 11 carries and 0 targets.Tyler Allgeier(22.1%) got 8 carries whileCordarrelle Patterson(17.6%) has worked his way back into the mix.Drake London(54.4%) left this game with a groin injury which 
                allowedVan Jefferson(70.6%) to play the most snaps. The hodgepodge 
                of other receivers includedKhaDarel Hodge(42.6%),Scotty Miller(33.8%) andMack Hollins(20.6%). None of this group is fantasy 
                worthy.Kyle Pitts(60.3%) was out-snapped byJonnu Smith(70.6%) but 
                Jonnu had only 1 target compared to 5 targets for Pitts (3-35-0).Will Levis(97.1%) played the majority of the game at QB for 
                the Titans finishing 19 of 29 for 238-4-0 and 11 yards rushing.Malik Willis(2.9%) had two carries on zero pass attempts. QB 
                is a dumpster fire across the league so Levis will be an option 
                on the waiver wire.Trade rumors continue to swirl aroundDerrick Henry(64.7%).Tyjae Spears(44.1%) would see a spike in value if Henry gets 
                moved.DeAndre Hopkins(63.2%) caught 4 passes and three went for TDs.MIN @ GBOffensive SnapsVikings: 72Packers: 68Kirk Cousins(84.7%) tore his Achilles and is out for the season. 
                The Vikings QB options includedJaren Hall(15.3%),Nick Mullens(IR-back injury, Wk10?) andSean Mannionwho is on the practice 
                squad.The RB split continues favorAlexander Mattison(61.1%) overCam Akers(23.6%) with Mattison out-touching Akers 17 to 10.Jordan Addison(94.4%),K.J. Osborn(86.1%) andBrandon Powell(52.8%) continue work as the top three receivers. All take a hit 
                with Cousins out.Aaron Jonescontinues to be limited with his hamstring injury 
                but did play the same number of snaps (35) asAJ Dillon. Jones 
                had 12 opportunities while Dillon had 11.Poor play fromJordan LovemakesChristian Watson(82.4%),Romeo Doubs(82.4%) andJayden Reed(77.9%) risky business on a weekly 
                basis.LAR @ DALOffensive SnapsRams: 62Cowboys: 65Matthew Stafford(67.7%) injured his thumb in this game allowingBrett Rypien(32.3%) to get some run in garbage time.Once again, the Rams split the RB work betweenDarrell Henderson(46.8%) andRoyce Freeman(53.2%). This should be sticky untilKyren Williamsreturns.Myles Gaskindid not play an offensive

This was a better matchup forCalvin Ridley(85.9%) and he led

TEEvan Engram(78.9%) also had a 31.3% target share.

                time as he plays behindBreece Hall(64.1%) andMichael Carter(23.4%).

Randall Cobbwas inactive so the Jets rotatedMalik Taylor(35.9%) 
                andXavier Gipson(25.0%) through the No.3 spot behindGarrett Wilson(89.1%) andAllen Lazard(81.2%). Only Wilson is fantasy

The Giants are a mess.Tyrod Taylor(33.3%) left with a rib injury 
                which allowedTommy DeVito(66.7%) to see some action. The two 
                QBs threw the ball a combined 14 times for 7… yes…

Kendrick Bourne(60.4%) tore his ACL and will miss the remainder

                a touchdown.

A week after theBijan Robinsonshenanigans, he played 73.5%

Drake London(54.4%) left this game with a groin injury which 
                allowedVan Jefferson(70.6%) to play the most snaps. The hodgepodge 
                of other receivers includedKhaDarel Hodge(42.6%),Scotty Miller(33.8%) andMack Hollins(20.6%). None of this group is fantasy 
                worthy.

Kyle Pitts(60.3%) was out-snapped byJonnu Smith(70.6%) but 
                Jonnu had only 1 target compared to 5 targets for Pitts (3-35-0).

Will Levis(97.1%) played the majority of the game at QB for 
                the Titans finishing 19 of 29 for 238-4-0 and 11 yards rushing.Malik Willis(2.9%) had two carries on zero pass attempts. QB 
                is a dumpster fire across the league so Levis will be an option 
                on the waiver wire.

Trade rumors continue to swirl aroundDerrick Henry(64.7%).Tyjae Spears(44.1%) would see a spike in value if Henry gets 
                moved.

                squad.

The RB split continues favorAlexander Mattison(61.1%) overCam Akers(23.6%) with Mattison out-touching Akers 17 to 10.

Jordan Addison(94.4%),K.J. Osborn(86.1%) andBrandon Powell(52.8%) continue work as the top three receivers. All take a hit 
                with Cousins out.

Aaron Jonescontinues to be limited with his hamstring injury 
                but did play the same number of snaps (35) asAJ Dillon. Jones 
                had 12 opportunities while Dillon had 11.

                snap.

Tony Pollard(64.6%) can’t get on track this season. He’s 
                a volume-based mid-range RB2.

Zach Charbonnet(58.6%) played more snaps thanKenneth Walker(41.4%) this week as Walker was dealing with a calf injury coming 
                into the game.

                role but doesn’t get enough touches.

Tee Higgins(66.7%) remains somewhat limited by his rib issue 
                allowingTrenton Irwin(27.0%) andAndrei Iosivas(15.9%) to fill 
                in the gap.

Ja’Marr Chase(88.9%) had a 37.5% target share.

Christian McCaffrey(96.6%) missed two snaps on his way to 12-54-1, 
                6-64-1.Elijah Mitchell(11.9%) is firmly ahead ofJordan Mason(0.0%).

Another week ofDeebo Samuelbeing out, led toBrandon Aiyuk(91.5%) to a 30.0% target share.Jauan Jennings(84.7%) didn’t 
                see a target.

TEGeorge Kittle(93.2%) saw a 36.7% target share.



BAL @ ARI

Gus Edwards(52.3%) andJustice Hill(47.7%) are still splitting 
                snaps relatively equally but it’s Edwards (19-80-3, 2-14-0) 
                that’s finding the endzone. Hill had 8 touches and 55 yards.

Zay Flowers(75.4%) saw 7 targets but had a disappointing 5-19-0 
                line. He’s the only fantasy viable WR in the Ravens offense.

Emari Demercado(54.5%) was the clear lead RB for the Cardinals 
                handling 21 touches.Keaontay Ingram(37.7%) only had 3 touches.

Marquise Brownplayed 94.8% of the snaps but doesn’t have 
                a ceiling withJoshua Dobbsat quarterback.

TETrey McBride(81.8%) is a thing. He had a 38.9% target share 
                and should be rostered.



CHI @ LAC

Roschon Johnson(36.4%) finally returned from his concussion to formed a three-man 
                committee withD’Onta 
                Foreman(31.8%) andDarrynton 
                Evans(27.3%). Not great. Nobody is playable in this scenario. 
                Both Foreman and Johnson had 10 touches.

D.J. Moore(87.9%) and TECole Kmet(83.3%) are the only receiving 
                options to consider. Kmet had a 27.0% target share.

Austin Ekeler(66.7%) got going in the receiving game (21.1% 
                target share) whileJoshua Kelley(21.7%) worked as the No.2 RB.

Josh Palmer(68.1%) missed some time in this game to have his 
                right knee looked at. He did return, but his absence allowed rookieQuentin Johnston(69.6%) to see a 15.8% target share.

With TEGerald Everettout,Donald Parham(62.3%) saw five targets. 
                He’s a viable streamer whenever Everett is out.



LV @ DET

The disparity in play volume tells you how this game went. It 
                was a monster forJahmyr Gibbswho played 69.8% of the snaps withDavid Montgomeryout. Gibbs handled 31 touches and finished as 
                the highest scoring RB of the week.Craig Reynolds(27.9%) handled 
                15 touches (14-74-0, 1-12-0).Amon-Ra St. Brown(91.9%),Josh Reynolds(82.6%) andJameson Williams(39.5%) played the most at WR withKalif Raymond(24.4%) 
                seeing the field as well. ASB and Reynolds are the only two that 
                are fantasy viable.Josh Jacobs(76.1%) totaled 88 yards and found the endzone.Ameer Abdullah(21.7%) was working as the No.2 back.A visibly frustratedDavante Adams(95.7%) was targeted 7 times 
                but only caught one for 11 yards.Jakobi Meyers(97.8%) andHunter Renfrow(60.9%) combined for three catches asJimmy Garoppolocompleted just 10 passes on the night.TEMichael Mayerplayed 91.3% of the snaps.Please enable JavaScript to view thecomments powered by Disqus.

TEN @ PIT

Offensive SnapsTitans: 74Steelers: 65We’ve seen this a few times during the season:Tyjae Spears(59.5%) played more snaps thanDerrick Henry(48.6%) but Henry 
                continues to get more touches (20 to 9).Treylon Burks(51.4%) left with on a stretcher after banging his head/neck on 
                the turf trying to make a catch. He seems to be OK the day after. 
                This passing offense is only able to support one pass catcher 
                and that isDeAndre 
                Hopkins(68.9%) who had a 29.7% target share.TheNajee Harris(58.5%),Jaylen Warren(40.0%) split remains 
                60-40 with Warren having stand-alone value. Harris had 20 opportunities 
                and scored a TD while Warren had 14 opportunities and totaled 
                113 yards.Finally!Diontae Johnson’s long scoring drought is over. 
                Johnson played 87.7% of the snaps and saw a 31.0% target share. 
                Pickett is not very accurate, missing Johnson andGeorge Pickens(89.2%) on throws that could’ve led to a bigger night for 
                both.At tight end, Conner Heyward (61.5%) continues to play more thanDarnell Washington(49.2%) for the Steelers.MIA @ KCOffensive SnapsDolphins: 63Chiefs: 60The Dolphins continue to rotate three RBs withSalvon Ahmed(30.2%) 
                playing more snaps thanJeff Wilson(17.5%) against the Chiefs.Raheem Mostert(55.6%) is the only fantasy viable option at the 
                moment.Jaylen Waddle(54.0%) left the game and missed a few snaps but did return.Cedrick 
                Wilson(65.1%) picked up the slack overBraxton 
                Berrios(27.0%) andChase 
                Claypool(22.2%).WithClyde 
                Edwards-HelaireinactiveLa'Mical 
                Perinepicked up 4 snaps behindIsiah 
                Pacheco(68.3%) andJerick 
                McKinnon(25.0%).The Chiefs wide receiver group continues to be a mess for fantasy 
                lineups.Rashee 
                Rice(68.3%) is really the only consideration.Justin 
                Watson(63.3%) andMarquez 
                Valdes-Scantling(55.0%) were best of the rest but nobody 
                had a target share above 18.0%.Kadarius 
                Toney(11.7%) continues to earn snaps at a very low rate.The Dolphins used a lot of double-teams onTravis Kelce(76.7%) 
                who had his worst game of the season (3-14-0).LAR @ GBOffensive SnapsRams: 58Packers: 72The Rams have settled on a two-man backfield withDarrell Henderson(58.6%) andRoyce Freeman(41.4%) handling the load. Henderson 
                is the preferred option for his use in the passing game. Both 
                had 12 touches.Hopefully the bye will helpMatthew Stafford(thumb) get back 
                on the field, because the passing game took a hit withBrett Rypienat the helm.Cooper Kupp(84.5%),Puka Nacua(81.0%) andTutu Atwell(67.2%) all had 7 targets.The Packers “unleashed”Aaron Jonesto the tune of 
                56.9% of the snaps. Yawn. He did get 24 touches which is encouraging 
                and had his best performance (20-73-1, 4-26-0) since injuring 
                his hamstring in Week 1.AJ Dillon(40.3%) had 10 touches.It’s going to be a lost season forChristian Watson(77.8%) 
                who is saddled with bad quarterback play and injuries. These young 
                Packers receivers are learning on the job and it’s going 
                to be difficult to trust them in lineups.WAS @ NEOffensive SnapsCommanders: 78Patriots: 64Chris 
                Rodriguez Jr.has been axed out of the running back rotation 
                for now.Brian 
                Robinson Jr.(56.4%) andAntonio 
                Gibson(43.6%) continue to handle all the work with Robinson 
                the clear lead back.WithCurtis 
                Samuelout,Jamison 
                Crowder(47.4%),Dyami 
                Brown(29.5%) andByron 
                Pringle(23.1%) all saw a bump in snap share behindTerry 
                McLaurin(85.9%) andJahan 
                Dotson(75.6%). Dotson has 18 targets in his last two games.The Patriots are committed to their two-man backfield.Rhamondre Stevenson(62.5%) is still the lead back overEzekiel Elliott(39.1%).Injuries to the wide receiver group, led to a fairly tight WR 
                rotation for New England.Demario Douglas(82.8%) andJalen Reagor(76.6%) played the most whileJuJu Smith-Schuster(35.9%) continued 
                to see a lesser role. However, both JuJu and Douglas had 7 targets.The Patriots played a lot of two-TE sets withHunter 
                Henry(87.5%) andMike 
                Gesicki(85.9%). Henry also had 7 targets.TB @ HOUOffensive SnapsBuccaneers: 66Texans: 72Rachaad White(80.3%) had his best fantasy game (20-73-2, 4-46-0) of the season 
                and saw 20 carries with a 13.3% target share.Chase 
                Edmonds(12.1%) played slightly ahead ofKe'Shawn 
                Vaughn(7.6%).The Bucs continued with their tight WR rotation involvingMike Evans(73.3%),Chris Godwin(87.9%) andTrey Palmer(72.7%). Only 
                Evans and Godwin are fantasy viable.TECade Ottonplayed every snap for the Bucs and had his best 
                game (6-70-2) of the season on 9 targets.It wasn’t too surprising thatDevin Singletary(75.0%) 
                failed (13-26-0. 2-0-0) against a fairly difficult Tampa run defense.Mike Boone(19.0%) worked as the backup withDameon Pierceinactive. 
                Pierce should be back in Week 10.The Texans passing game blew up withC.J. 
                Stroudtossing 5 TDs to go along with 470 yards.Noah 
                Brown(72.2%) got in the action as the third receiver behindNico Collins(79.2%) andTank 
                Dell(84.7%).TEDalton Schultz(79.2%) had his best fantasy game (10-130-1) 
                of the season and saw a 28.9% target share.ARI @ CLEOffensive SnapsCardinals: 52Browns: 73The Cardinals continue to surprise us with their RB usage.Emari Demercadowas inactive which allowedKeaontay Ingram(42.3%) andTony Jones(40.4%) to split the workload. Neither RB could do 
                anything against the Browns-D.It was a day to forget for the Cardinals passing game withClayton Tuneat the helm. Tune managed 58 passing yards… total.Michael Wilsonprobably considers himself lucky for being inactive.Jerome Ford(64.4%) was back to a lead-back role for the Browns. 
                He saw 27 opportunities toKareem Hunt’s (28.8%) 15. The 
                Browns ran the ball 40 times as they shutout the Cardinals.Cedric Tillman(74.0%) filled the third WR role after the Browns 
                traded awayDonovan Peoples-Jones. He had just 1 target as Watson 
                only threw the ball 30 times.TEDavid Njoku(76.7%) has scored in back-to-back games.CHI @ NOOffensive SnapsBears: 68Saints: 63People keep wantingRoschon 
                Johnsonto be a thing, but he isn’t. He played 29.4% of the 
                snaps and had 3 touches. Meanwhile,D'Onta 
                Foremanplayed 58.8% of the snaps and had 20 touches, all 
                carries.Tyler Scott(58.8%) continues to hold down the No.3 wide receiver 
                role behindD.J. Moore(97.1%) andDarnell Mooney(86.8%) in Chicago 
                but he isn’t fantasy viable.Another solid game from TECole Kmet(85.3%) who has 18 targets 
                in his last two games.Taysom Hill(46.0%) is a thing. He was involved in two more TDs 
                this week, one receiving and one passing. He also had 11 carries 
                for 52 yards.Meanwhile,Alvin Kamara(49.2%) had 9 carries andJamaal Williams(42.9%) had 6 opportunities. This Taysom usage continues to be 
                an issue for Kamara and the rest of the skill players.Case in point:Michael Thomasposted a goose-egg while playing 
                63.5% of the snaps.SEA @ BALOffensive SnapsSeahawks: 49Ravens: 76For the second week in a row,Zach Charbonnet(55.1%) played 
                more snaps thanKenneth Walker(49.0%). Walker did have more opportunities 
                11 to 9. The last two weeks have been difficult rushing matchups 
                (CLE, BAL) but we need to keep a close eye on this usage.Gus Edwardsonly played 18.4% of the snaps and got just five 
                carries as the Ravens ran away from the Seahawks.Justice Hill(63.2%) andKeaton Mitchell(18.4%) handled most of the rushing 
                work. Mitchell is an intriguing bench stash but will likely need 
                an injury to have any trust-worthy fantasy value.The Ravens were chirping all week along thatOdell Beckham Jr.(46.1%) would find the endzone soon. He did. The WR rotation was 
                spread out amongZay Flowers(68.4%),Rashod Bateman(56.6%) andNelson Agholor(55.3%) as they dominated snaps and the scoreboard.MIN @ ATLOffensive SnapsVikings: 75Falcons: 69Jaren Hall(18.2%) was concussed early in this game which requiredJoshua Dobbs(85.3%) to be thrust into action.Cam Akers(30.7%) tore his Achilles and will miss the rest of 
                the season.Alexander Mattison(56.0%) continues to be inefficient 
                but the Vikings don’t have much of a chose but to give him 
                touches.Ty Chandlershould see some action next week.Jordan Addisonplayed 97.3% of the snaps. He and the rest of 
                the Vikings pass catches will be getting to know their new quarterback 
                in the coming weeks.K.J. Osborn(26.7%) left with a concussion 
                allowingTrishton Jacksonto play 70.7% of the snaps.TET.J. Hockenson(84.0%) saw a 34.3% target share. This may 
                be sticky while Dobbs gets acquainted with his new receivers.Another team with a new QB is the Falcons who gaveTaylor Heinickea shot this week.BothTyler Allgeier(34.8%) andBijan Robinson(60.9%) got 15 
                opportunities. Robinson is nothing more than a middling RB2 with 
                Arthur Smith calling the shots.WithDrake Londonout, the Falcons usedVan Jefferson(65.2%),KhaDarel Hodge(66.7%),Scotty Miller(30.4%),Damiere Byrd(27.5%) 
                andMack Hollins(20.3%). Gross. Hodge had the biggest target 
                share (17.6%).Both tight ends played the same number of snaps (39).Jonnu Smithwent 5-100-1 on six targets whileKyle Pittswent 4-56-0 on five 
                targets.IND @ CAROffensive SnapsColts: 61Panthers: 71Jonathan Taylorfinally got lead-back usage, playing 73.8% snaps 
                and getting 23 opportunities.Zack Mossplayed 21.3% of the snaps 
                and got 7 carries. This should be the typical split moving forward.Josh Downs(19.7%) came into the game with a knee injury and 
                left in the first half.Isaiah McKenzie(44.3%) helped fill in 
                the gap behindMichael Pittman Jr.(88.5%) andAlec Pierce(100%).TEKylen Gransonreturned to action and played 49.2% of the snaps. 
                None of Colts tight ends are fantasy viable.Chuba Hubbard(63.0%) continued to be the lead back for the Panthers 
                overMiles Sanders(24.7%). Hubbard had 22 opportunities to 11 
                for Sanders.Adam Thielen(97.3%) was marked byKenny Moore(2 TDs) most of 
                the day.Jonathan Mingoplayed 95.9% of the snaps but only had 
                1 catch for 5 yards.TETommy Tremble(43.8%) andHayden Hurst(57.5%) split tight 
                end duties this week with Hurst having the better game (2-54-0).NYG @ LVOffensive SnapsGiants: 63Raiders: 60What a mess the Giants are. QBDaniel 
                Jones(33.3%) is out for the season with an ACL injury.Tommy 
                DeVito(66.7%) is now at the controls. Yikes.Saquon Barkley(74.6%) is the only fantasy option on this team. 
                He had 20 touches for 113 yards.Josh Jacobs(78.3%) turned 26 carries into 98 yards and 2 TDs. 
                No targets.Tre Tucker(46.7%) earned more snaps thanHunter Renfrow(21.7%). 
                Both had 3 targets. Another quiet day forDavante Adams(88.3%) 
                who had 7 targets for a 4-34-0 line.DAL @ PHIOffensive SnapsCowboys: 75Eagles: 62It just isn’t happening forTony Pollard(77.3%). He turned 
                17 opportunities into 63 yards.CeeDee Lamb(93.3%) has been on a two-game tear: 30 targets, 
                23 receptions, 361 yards, 2 TDsBrandin Cooks(77.3%) had 1 catch for 7 yards on 2 targets.TEJake Ferguson(89.3%) had a 22.7% target share and has his 
                best fantasy game of the season (7-91-1).Boston Scottwas inactive which allowedRashaad Pennyto play… 
                2 snaps.Olamide Zaccheaus(41.9%) andJulio Jones(30.6%) split the No.3 
                wide receiver role. Zaccheaus had 2 targets, Julio zero.TEDallas 
                Goedertis going to miss some time with a broken forearm.Jack Stoll(43.5%) is the next man up, but it's doubtful he’ll command the 
                same target share as Goedert.BUF @ CINOffensive SnapsBills: 58Bengals: 70James Cook(55.2%) is still the back to own in Buffalo as he 
                splits time withLatavius Murray(44.8%) but Cook only has low-end 
                RB2 value in this offense centered aroundJosh Allenand the passing 
                game.Khalil Shakir(70.7%) is working as the No.3 wideout but is behind 
                Kincaid in targets.TEDalton Kincaid(89.7%) had a whopping 34.4% target share. 
                He’s an easy TE1.Trayveon Williams(18.6%) continues to work as the No.2 RB behindJoe Mixon(72.9%) for the Bengals.Tee Higgins(82.9%) seemed healthy in this game and had 9 targets (8-110-0) 
                as the Bills focused onJa’Marr 
                Chase(90.0%).LAC NYJOffensive SnapsChargers: 58Jets: 81The Chargers had trouble moving the ball against the Jets as 
                evidenced by just 58 plays. They only had two running backs active:Austin Ekeler(67.2%) andJoshua Kelley(34.5%).WithJosh Palmeron IR,Quentin Johnston(82.8%) was thrust into 
                a starting role.Jalen Guyton(56.9%) handled No.3 wide receiver 
                duties. Johnston might be serviceable as a Flex option in better 
                matchups.The Chargers used four TEs which caps the upside ofGerald Everettwho played just 55.2% of the snaps and saw a 7.1% target share.Despite 81 plays, the Jets offense struggled all night and could 
                not get in the endzone.Michael Carter(30.9%) got some run in 
                garbage time but played well behindBreece Hall(60.5%).Dalvin Cookwill only be viable if Hall gets injured.Garrett Wilson(97.5%) is the only fantasy viable pass catcher 
                on this team. He had a 27.1% target share.Please enable JavaScript to view thecomments powered by Disqus.

We’ve seen this a few times during the season:Tyjae Spears(59.5%) played more snaps thanDerrick Henry(48.6%) but Henry 
                continues to get more touches (20 to 9).

Treylon Burks(51.4%) left with on a stretcher after banging his head/neck on 
                the turf trying to make a catch. He seems to be OK the day after. 
                This passing offense is only able to support one pass catcher 
                and that isDeAndre 
                Hopkins(68.9%) who had a 29.7% target share.

TheNajee Harris(58.5%),Jaylen Warren(40.0%) split remains 
                60-40 with Warren having stand-alone value. Harris had 20 opportunities 
                and scored a TD while Warren had 14 opportunities and totaled 
                113 yards.

Finally!Diontae Johnson’s long scoring drought is over. 
                Johnson played 87.7% of the snaps and saw a 31.0% target share. 
                Pickett is not very accurate, missing Johnson andGeorge Pickens(89.2%) on throws that could’ve led to a bigger night for 
                both.

At tight end, Conner Heyward (61.5%) continues to play more thanDarnell Washington(49.2%) for the Steelers.



MIA @ KC

Offensive SnapsDolphins: 63Chiefs: 60

The Dolphins continue to rotate three RBs withSalvon Ahmed(30.2%) 
                playing more snaps thanJeff Wilson(17.5%) against the Chiefs.Raheem Mostert(55.6%) is the only fantasy viable option at the 
                moment.

Jaylen Waddle(54.0%) left the game and missed a few snaps but did return.Cedrick 
                Wilson(65.1%) picked up the slack overBraxton 
                Berrios(27.0%) andChase 
                Claypool(22.2%).

WithClyde 
                Edwards-HelaireinactiveLa'Mical 
                Perinepicked up 4 snaps behindIsiah 
                Pacheco(68.3%) andJerick 
                McKinnon(25.0%).

The Chiefs wide receiver group continues to be a mess for fantasy 
                lineups.Rashee 
                Rice(68.3%) is really the only consideration.Justin 
                Watson(63.3%) andMarquez 
                Valdes-Scantling(55.0%) were best of the rest but nobody 
                had a target share above 18.0%.Kadarius 
                Toney(11.7%) continues to earn snaps at a very low rate.

The Dolphins used a lot of double-teams onTravis Kelce(76.7%) 
                who had his worst game of the season (3-14-0).



LAR @ GB

The Rams have settled on a two-man backfield withDarrell Henderson(58.6%) andRoyce Freeman(41.4%) handling the load. Henderson 
                is the preferred option for his use in the passing game. Both 
                had 12 touches.

Hopefully the bye will helpMatthew Stafford(thumb) get back 
                on the field, because the passing game took a hit withBrett Rypienat the helm.Cooper Kupp(84.5%),Puka Nacua(81.0%) andTutu Atwell(67.2%) all had 7 targets.

The Packers “unleashed”Aaron Jonesto the tune of 
                56.9% of the snaps. Yawn. He did get 24 touches which is encouraging 
                and had his best performance (20-73-1, 4-26-0) since injuring 
                his hamstring in Week 1.AJ Dillon(40.3%) had 10 touches.

It’s going to be a lost season forChristian Watson(77.8%) 
                who is saddled with bad quarterback play and injuries. These young 
                Packers receivers are learning on the job and it’s going 
                to be difficult to trust them in lineups.



WAS @ NE

Chris 
                Rodriguez Jr.has been axed out of the running back rotation 
                for now.Brian 
                Robinson Jr.(56.4%) andAntonio 
                Gibson(43.6%) continue to handle all the work with Robinson 
                the clear lead back.

WithCurtis 
                Samuelout,Jamison 
                Crowder(47.4%),Dyami 
                Brown(29.5%) andByron 
                Pringle(23.1%) all saw a bump in snap share behindTerry 
                McLaurin(85.9%) andJahan 
                Dotson(75.6%). Dotson has 18 targets in his last two games.

The Patriots are committed to their two-man backfield.Rhamondre Stevenson(62.5%) is still the lead back overEzekiel Elliott(39.1%).

Injuries to the wide receiver group, led to a fairly tight WR 
                rotation for New England.Demario Douglas(82.8%) andJalen Reagor(76.6%) played the most whileJuJu Smith-Schuster(35.9%) continued 
                to see a lesser role. However, both JuJu and Douglas had 7 targets.

The Patriots played a lot of two-TE sets withHunter 
                Henry(87.5%) andMike 
                Gesicki(85.9%). Henry also had 7 targets.



TB @ HOU

Rachaad White(80.3%) had his best fantasy game (20-73-2, 4-46-0) of the season 
                and saw 20 carries with a 13.3% target share.Chase 
                Edmonds(12.1%) played slightly ahead ofKe'Shawn 
                Vaughn(7.6%).

The Bucs continued with their tight WR rotation involvingMike Evans(73.3%),Chris Godwin(87.9%) andTrey Palmer(72.7%). Only 
                Evans and Godwin are fantasy viable.

TECade Ottonplayed every snap for the Bucs and had his best 
                game (6-70-2) of the season on 9 targets.

It wasn’t too surprising thatDevin Singletary(75.0%) 
                failed (13-26-0. 2-0-0) against a fairly difficult Tampa run defense.Mike Boone(19.0%) worked as the backup withDameon Pierceinactive. 
                Pierce should be back in Week 10.

The Texans passing game blew up withC.J. 
                Stroudtossing 5 TDs to go along with 470 yards.Noah 
                Brown(72.2%) got in the action as the third receiver behindNico Collins(79.2%) andTank 
                Dell(84.7%).

TEDalton Schultz(79.2%) had his best fantasy game (10-130-1) 
                of the season and saw a 28.9% target share.



ARI @ CLE

The Cardinals continue to surprise us with their RB usage.Emari Demercadowas inactive which allowedKeaontay Ingram(42.3%) andTony Jones(40.4%) to split the workload. Neither RB could do 
                anything against the Browns-D.

It was a day to forget for the Cardinals passing game withClayton Tuneat the helm. Tune managed 58 passing yards… total.Michael Wilsonprobably considers himself lucky for being inactive.

Jerome Ford(64.4%) was back to a lead-back role for the Browns. 
                He saw 27 opportunities toKareem Hunt’s (28.8%) 15. The 
                Browns ran the ball 40 times as they shutout the Cardinals.

Cedric Tillman(74.0%) filled the third WR role after the Browns 
                traded awayDonovan Peoples-Jones. He had just 1 target as Watson 
                only threw the ball 30 times.

TEDavid Njoku(76.7%) has scored in back-to-back games.



CHI @ NO

People keep wantingRoschon 
                Johnsonto be a thing, but he isn’t. He played 29.4% of the 
                snaps and had 3 touches. Meanwhile,D'Onta 
                Foremanplayed 58.8% of the snaps and had 20 touches, all 
                carries.

Tyler Scott(58.8%) continues to hold down the No.3 wide receiver 
                role behindD.J. Moore(97.1%) andDarnell Mooney(86.8%) in Chicago 
                but he isn’t fantasy viable.

Another solid game from TECole Kmet(85.3%) who has 18 targets 
                in his last two games.

Taysom Hill(46.0%) is a thing. He was involved in two more TDs 
                this week, one receiving and one passing. He also had 11 carries 
                for 52 yards.

Meanwhile,Alvin Kamara(49.2%) had 9 carries andJamaal Williams(42.9%) had 6 opportunities. This Taysom usage continues to be 
                an issue for Kamara and the rest of the skill players.

Case in point:Michael Thomasposted a goose-egg while playing 
                63.5% of the snaps.



SEA @ BAL

For the second week in a row,Zach Charbonnet(55.1%) played 
                more snaps thanKenneth Walker(49.0%). Walker did have more opportunities 
                11 to 9. The last two weeks have been difficult rushing matchups 
                (CLE, BAL) but we need to keep a close eye on this usage.

Gus Edwardsonly played 18.4% of the snaps and got just five 
                carries as the Ravens ran away from the Seahawks.Justice Hill(63.2%) andKeaton Mitchell(18.4%) handled most of the rushing 
                work. Mitchell is an intriguing bench stash but will likely need 
                an injury to have any trust-worthy fantasy value.

The Ravens were chirping all week along thatOdell Beckham Jr.(46.1%) would find the endzone soon. He did. The WR rotation was 
                spread out amongZay Flowers(68.4%),Rashod Bateman(56.6%) andNelson Agholor(55.3%) as they dominated snaps and the scoreboard.



MIN @ ATL

Jaren Hall(18.2%) was concussed early in this game which requiredJoshua Dobbs(85.3%) to be thrust into action.

Cam Akers(30.7%) tore his Achilles and will miss the rest of 
                the season.Alexander Mattison(56.0%) continues to be inefficient 
                but the Vikings don’t have much of a chose but to give him 
                touches.Ty Chandlershould see some action next week.

Jordan Addisonplayed 97.3% of the snaps. He and the rest of 
                the Vikings pass catches will be getting to know their new quarterback 
                in the coming weeks.K.J. Osborn(26.7%) left with a concussion 
                allowingTrishton Jacksonto play 70.7% of the snaps.

TET.J. Hockenson(84.0%) saw a 34.3% target share. This may 
                be sticky while Dobbs gets acquainted with his new receivers.

Another team with a new QB is the Falcons who gaveTaylor Heinickea shot this week.

BothTyler Allgeier(34.8%) andBijan Robinson(60.9%) got 15 
                opportunities. Robinson is nothing more than a middling RB2 with 
                Arthur Smith calling the shots.

WithDrake Londonout, the Falcons usedVan Jefferson(65.2%),KhaDarel Hodge(66.7%),Scotty Miller(30.4%),Damiere Byrd(27.5%) 
                andMack Hollins(20.3%). Gross. Hodge had the biggest target 
                share (17.6%).

Both tight ends played the same number of snaps (39).Jonnu Smithwent 5-100-1 on six targets whileKyle Pittswent 4-56-0 on five 
                targets.



IND @ CAR

Jonathan Taylorfinally got lead-back usage, playing 73.8% snaps 
                and getting 23 opportunities.Zack Mossplayed 21.3% of the snaps 
                and got 7 carries. This should be the typical split moving forward.

Josh Downs(19.7%) came into the game with a knee injury and 
                left in the first half.Isaiah McKenzie(44.3%) helped fill in 
                the gap behindMichael Pittman Jr.(88.5%) andAlec Pierce(100%).

TEKylen Gransonreturned to action and played 49.2% of the snaps. 
                None of Colts tight ends are fantasy viable.

Chuba Hubbard(63.0%) continued to be the lead back for the Panthers 
                overMiles Sanders(24.7%). Hubbard had 22 opportunities to 11 
                for Sanders.

Adam Thielen(97.3%) was marked byKenny Moore(2 TDs) most of 
                the day.Jonathan Mingoplayed 95.9% of the snaps but only had 
                1 catch for 5 yards.

TETommy Tremble(43.8%) andHayden Hurst(57.5%) split tight 
                end duties this week with Hurst having the better game (2-54-0).



NYG @ LV

What a mess the Giants are. QBDaniel 
                Jones(33.3%) is out for the season with an ACL injury.Tommy 
                DeVito(66.7%) is now at the controls. Yikes.

Saquon Barkley(74.6%) is the only fantasy option on this team. 
                He had 20 touches for 113 yards.

Josh Jacobs(78.3%) turned 26 carries into 98 yards and 2 TDs. 
                No targets.

Tre Tucker(46.7%) earned more snaps thanHunter Renfrow(21.7%). 
                Both had 3 targets. Another quiet day forDavante Adams(88.3%) 
                who had 7 targets for a 4-34-0 line.



DAL @ PHI

It just isn’t happening forTony Pollard(77.3%). He turned 
                17 opportunities into 63 yards.

CeeDee Lamb(93.3%) has been on a two-game tear: 30 targets, 
                23 receptions, 361 yards, 2 TDs

Brandin Cooks(77.3%) had 1 catch for 7 yards on 2 targets.

TEJake Ferguson(89.3%) had a 22.7% target share and has his 
                best fantasy game of the season (7-91-1).

Boston Scottwas inactive which allowedRashaad Pennyto play… 
                2 snaps.

Olamide Zaccheaus(41.9%) andJulio Jones(30.6%) split the No.3 
                wide receiver role. Zaccheaus had 2 targets, Julio zero.

TEDallas 
                Goedertis going to miss some time with a broken forearm.Jack Stoll(43.5%) is the next man up, but it's doubtful he’ll command the 
                same target share as Goedert.



BUF @ CIN

James Cook(55.2%) is still the back to own in Buffalo as he 
                splits time withLatavius Murray(44.8%) but Cook only has low-end 
                RB2 value in this offense centered aroundJosh Allenand the passing 
                game.

Khalil Shakir(70.7%) is working as the No.3 wideout but is behind 
                Kincaid in targets.

TEDalton Kincaid(89.7%) had a whopping 34.4% target share. 
                He’s an easy TE1.

Trayveon Williams(18.6%) continues to work as the No.2 RB behindJoe Mixon(72.9%) for the Bengals.

Tee Higgins(82.9%) seemed healthy in this game and had 9 targets (8-110-0) 
                as the Bills focused onJa’Marr 
                Chase(90.0%).



LAC NYJ

Offensive SnapsChargers: 58Jets: 81

The Chargers had trouble moving the ball against the Jets as 
                evidenced by just 58 plays. They only had two running backs active:Austin Ekeler(67.2%) andJoshua Kelley(34.5%).

WithJosh Palmeron IR,Quentin Johnston(82.8%) was thrust into 
                a starting role.Jalen Guyton(56.9%) handled No.3 wide receiver 
                duties. Johnston might be serviceable as a Flex option in better 
                matchups.

The Chargers used four TEs which caps the upside ofGerald Everettwho played just 55.2% of the snaps and saw a 7.1% target share.

Despite 81 plays, the Jets offense struggled all night and could 
                not get in the endzone.Michael Carter(30.9%) got some run in 
                garbage time but played well behindBreece Hall(60.5%).Dalvin Cookwill only be viable if Hall gets injured.

Garrett Wilson(97.5%) is the only fantasy viable pass catcher 
                on this team. He had a 27.1% target share.

Article Content:
CAR @ CHI

Offensive SnapsPanthers: 60Bears: 72Chuba Hubbard(50.0%) is still operating as the Panthers lead RB ahead ofMiles 
                Sanders(38.3%). Hubbard out-touched Sanders 11 to 4. The 
                offense isn’t great which makes Hubbard just a low-end Flex option 
                on a weekly basis.Adam Thielen(29.4% target share) played every snap and is really 
                the only pass catcher to be considered for Carolina.Jonathan Mingo(98.3%) is also an every-down player whenD.J. Charkis 
                out like he was this week.Khalil Herbertremains on IR but will likely be back in Week 11. That leftD’Onta 
                Foreman(52.8%) in the lead back role whileRoschon 
                Johnson(41.7%) filled the backup role. Johnson got a little 
                extra playing time towards the end of the first half when Foreman 
                was being checked for a foot issue. Foreman scored the only offensive 
                TD of the game.The lack of offense in this game carried through the Bears wideouts.D.J. Moore(93.1%) led the group with a 28.1% target share followed 
                byDarnell Mooney(66.7%) with a 12.5% target share.TECole Kmet(91.7%) had another solid game (5-45-0, 7 targets) 
                and remains a low-end TE1 option.IND @ NEOffensive SnapsColts: 57Patriots: 69The transition is complete.Jonathan Taylorplayed 87.7% of the 
                snaps compared to 15.8% forZack Moss. This is Taylor’s 
                backfield moving forward. He out-touched Moss 24 to 1. Moss is 
                a worth bench stash as a contingency play.Josh Downs(24.6%) was limited by a knee issue.Isaiah McKenziefilled in the gap, playing 45.6% of snaps and saw 4 targets (4-31-0).Alec Pierceis on the cardio club, playing 96.5% of snaps, but 
                isn’t a target earner in this offense.As usual, just two running backs saw playing time for New England:Rhamondre 
                Stevenson(66.7%) andEzekiel 
                Elliott(33.3%). The Patriots plodding, grind-it-out style 
                will keep Stevenson in the RB2 conversation.JuJu Smith-Schuster(98.6%) led all New England receivers in 
                snap share but saw just 1 target.Demario Douglas(72.5%) andKayshon Boutte(37.7%) were the only other receivers to see significant 
                snaps.DeVante Parkerwas inactive.GB @ PITOffensive SnapsPackers: 68Steelers: 65A week after being “unleashed”Aaron Jonesplayed 
                55.9% of the snaps whileAJ Dillonremained active playing 50.0% 
                of the snaps. Jones had 19 opportunities compared to 12 for Dillon. 
                This is the workload share we should expect moving forward.7 targets forChristian Watson(75.0%) but just a 2-23-0 line. 
                Disappointing.Romeo Doubs(82.4%),Jayden Reed(51.5%) andDontayvion Wicks(44.1%) make up the four-man rotation.A perfectly even split forNajee HarrisandJaylen Warrenas 
                both played 50.8% of the snaps. This is now back-to-back weeks 
                where Harris saw 20 opportunities. Warren had 19… the most 
                he’s had all season.The Steelers passing game continues to struggle withKenny Pickettunder center.George Pickens(95.4%),Diontae Johnson(81.5%) 
                andAllen Robinson(76.9%) continue to be the top three options. 
                Only Johnson and Pickens are fantasy viable.NO @ MINOffensive SnapsSaints: 67Vikings: 73Derek Carr(49.3%) left this game with a shoulder injury which 
                allowedJameis Winston(49.3%) to see some action. The Saints 
                have a bye in Week 11.WithKendre Millerout, the Saints stuck withAlvin Kamara(76.1%) 
                andJamaal Williams(22.4%) in a two-back rotation. 16 touches 
                for Kamara and just 5 for Williams.TETaysom Hillplayed 29.9% of the snaps and had just 3 touches 
                which was down a bit from previous weeks.Michael Thomasplayed 2 snaps then left with a knee injury. His 
                absence allowedA.T. Perryto play 83.6% of the snaps.Chris Olave(80.6%) andRashid Shaheed(68.7%) both saw a 25.0% target share.Alexander Mattison(45.2%) left with a concussion which allowedTy Chandler(43.8%) to get 15 carries (0 targets).Myles Gaskinhas bee signed and will likely be active next week if Mattison 
                can’t go.Jordan Addison(97.3%),Brandon Powell(67.1%) andJalen Nailor(91.8%) were the top three wideouts for Minnesota. Addison led 
                the group with a 21.9% target share while Nailor had just 1 target. 
                This group needsJustin Jeffersonback in a big way.It was reported thatT.J. Hockenson(63.0%) would be used on 
                a limited basis given his rib injury. His snap share was down,

                Johnson(21.1%).

Christian Kirk(89.5%) led the receiver group with a 35.5% target 
                share whileCalvin Ridleysaw just a 9.7% target share.Tim Jonesplayed 57.9% of the snaps withZay Jonesout.

Evan Engram’s low aDOT (4.01 yds for the season) combined 
                with poor efficiency (7 targets, 4 catches) equals fantasy death 
                (12 yards).



DET @ LAC

The Lions got in a shootout with the Chargers. In this scenario,Jahmyr Gibbs(57.6%) got more work thanDavid Montgomery(37.9%). 
                Gibbs (14-77-2, 3-35-0) had 19 opportunities to 12 for Montgomery 
                (12-116-1, 0-0-0).

Jameson 
                Williamsplayed 51.5% of the snaps behindAmon-Ra 
                St. Brown(92.4%) andJosh 
                Reynolds(69.7%) but had just two targets. ARSB had a 28.1% 
                target share.

TESam LaPorta(80.3%) had a quiet game but still managed 4-40-0 
                on five targets.

Austin Ekeler(69.4%) andJoshua Kelley(30.6%) handled the running 
                back for the Chargers. 26 opportunities for Ekeler.

Rookie WRQuentin Johnstonplayed 84.7% of the snaps and finished 
                with a 4-34-1 line on four targets.Jalen Guyton(79.2%) operated 
                as the third receiver behindKeenan Allen(75.0%) who saw a 35.0% 
                target share despite leaving the game for a bit with a shoulder 
                issue.



ATL @ ARI

Look at Arthur Smith givingBijan Robinson(74.6%) 23 touches 
                against the Cardinals! The running back workload also includedTyler Allgeier(26.8%) andCordarrelle Patterson(31.0%) who combined 
                for 15 touches.

Drake Londonwas back and played 77.5% of the snaps with a 22.2% 
                target share but the Falcons only threw the ball 21 times.

Kyle Pittsplayed 70.4% of the snaps whileJonnu Smithplayed 
                just 43.7% of the snaps.

James Connerstepped right back into a lead-RB role playing 63.1% 
                of the snaps. He finished with a 16-73-0 line with zero targets.Keaontay Ingram(21.5%) worked as the No.2 back withTony Jonesplaying 7 snaps.

Kyler Murraycompleted just 59.4% of his passes in his first 
                game back (19-32, 249-0-1). He had 6 carries, 33 yards and rush 
                TD and seemed to be moving fine.

The Cardinals usedMarquise Brown(100.0%),Michael Wilson(89.2%) 
                andRondale Moore(64.6%) as their top three receivers. Moore 
                had a 25.8% target share while Brown had just four targets and 
                finished with 1 catch, 28 yards.

TETrey McBride(76.9%) had a 29.0% target share and delivered 
                a 8-131-0 line. He’s in the weekly TE1 conversation.



WAS @ SEA

Brian Robinson Jr.(50.8%) had his first 100-yard game or the 
                season and it came through the air. He only had 8-38-0 on the 
                ground but finished with 6-119-1 receiving.

Antonio Gibson(47.5%) had a respectable 5-42-1 receiving as 
                well.

Curtis Samuelreturned to the lineup and played 50.8% of the 
                snaps. With so much production coming from the RBs, the WRs had 
                a quiet day includingJahan Dotsonwho played 95.1% of the snaps 
                but had just 2 targets.

Zach Charbonnet(51.9%) out-snappedKenneth Walker(48.1%) this 
                week but Walker had twice as many touches (20-10).

DK Metcalf(88.9%) andTyler Lockett(79.0%) both had target 
                shares above 23% whileJaxon Smith-Njigba(61.7%) had just a 11.9% 
                target share. JSN is going to need an injury to Metcalf or Lockett 
                to become a trusted fantasy asset.



NYG @ DAL

Saquon Barkley(61.4%) got in 14 touches during the beatdown 
                handed out by the Cowboys.

WithTommy DeVitoat quarterback, there’s no reason to 
                consider Giant pass catchers.

Everyone butTony Pollard(69.2%) scored a TD.Rico Dowdle(28.2%),CeeDee Lamb(76.9%),Brandin Cooks(52.6%),Michael Gallup(47.4%), 
                and TEJake Ferguson(66.7%). Lamb had a 31.8% target share and 
                now has 44 targets in his last three games.



NYJ @ LV

The Jets offense remains anemic.Breece Hall(69.7%) does what 
                he can but is limited to RB2 status.

Garrett Wilson(93.9%) had a 37.8% target share and is the only 
                bright spot in the passing game. His volume makes him an easy 
                WR2 in most formats. He had double-digit targets in five out of 
                his last six games.

This offense runs throughJosh Jacobs(82.8%) who had 29 touches 
                in this game. This should be the norm moving forward.

Davante Adamshad a 52.0% target share but was hampered by a 
                below-average QB and an above-average defense.



DEN @ BUF

The Broncos conservative offensive game plan calls for a lot 
                ofJavonte Williams(52.0%) who has now seen 25 and 30 touches 
                in back-to-back weeks.Samaje Perine(33.3%) works in obvious 
                passing situationsJaleel McLaughlin(14.7%) gets sprinkled in.

The only fantasy relevant receiver in Denver isCourtland 
                Sutton(86.7%) who had a 37.9% target share Monday night.Jerry Jeudyis left out in the cold due to a low-volume passing attack.Russell Wilsonhasn’t thrown the ball less than 30 times in five out of his last 
                six games.

Marvin Mimssaw a healthy 69.3% of the snaps but can’t 
                be trusted until the Broncos start throwing more.

The Bills and the Ravens ran the fewest plays (54) this week.

James Cook(46.3%) fumbled on the first offensive play and then 
                was benched for most of the first half which allowedLatavius Murray(51.9%) to rack up 11 touches for 69 yards and a TD. Cook 
                turned it on in the second half and managed 120 yards on just 
                14 touches.

Stefon Diggs(98.1%) was held in check (3-34-0) by Patrick Surtain and low 
                play volume.Gabriel 
                Davis(98.1%) had the highest target share (24.0%) of the 
                receivers whileKhalil 
                Shakir(75.9%) worked as the No.3 option.

Tight endDalton Kincaid(75.9%) also had a 24.0% target share. 
                He’s an easy TE1.

CIN @ BAL

Offensive SnapsBengals: 61Ravens: 66The Bengals lostJoe Burrow(44.3%) to a wrist injury in this 
                game which obviously damaged their offensive production.Jake Browning(55.7%) completed 57.1% of his passes in relief.Joe Mixon(63.9%) was the lone bright spot for the offense turning 
                in his second-best fantasy performance of the season (16-69-0, 
                5-31-1).Trayveon Williamsworked as the backup RB, playing 31.1% of the 
                snaps.Ja'Marr Chase(98.4%),Tyler 
                Boyd(90.2%) andTrenton 
                Irwin(95.1%) worked exclusively as the top three receivers.Tanner Hudson(34.4%) saw the most targets (4) from the tight end position, 
                ahead ofIrv Smith(39.3%) who has just two targets in his last two games.Keaton Mitchell(36.4%) played ahead ofJustice 
                Hill(25.8%) in this game, but the Ravens are still using 
                all three running backs which caps their upside… unless you’reGus Edwards(37.9%) who seemingly finds the endzone every week.Zay Flowers(98.5%) had a long catch-and-run TD called back on 
                a bad holding call.Odell Beckham Jr.(33.3%) missed some time 
                in this game with a shoulder issue but still managed 116 yards 
                on 4 catches.Rashod Bateman(78.8%) andNelson Agholor(40.9%) are also in 
                the mix, making it difficult to get usable production from Flowers.TEMark Andrews(10.6%) left early with an ankle injury and will 
                miss the remainder of the season which will affect this offense 
                moving forward. More use of the WRs should be expected andIsaiah Likely(74.2%) will be a priority pickup of the waiver wire.TEN @ JAXOffensive SnapsTitans: 40Jaguars: 71The extremely low play volume for Tennessee led to just 17 pass 
                attempts forWill Levisand 19 team rushing attempts.Derrick Henry(62.5%) andTyjae Spears(45.0%) were the only 
                running backs to play.WRChris Mooreplayed 75.0% of the snaps but saw just 1 target.Jacksonville’s blowout led toTank 
                Bigsby(14.1%) getting some extra work along withD’Ernest 
                Johnson(23.9%). The two backups combined for 17 touches.Calvin Ridley(80.3%) came to life with a 7-103-2 day whileZay Jonesreturned to his No.3 role playing 63.4% of the snaps.LAC @ GBOffensive SnapsChargers: 65Packers: 72Just 13 opportunities forAustin Ekeler(70.8%) this week (10-64-0, 
                2-6-0).Joshua Kelley(29.2%) was the only other RB to play a 
                snap.Keenan Allen(93.8%) now has double-digit targets in three out 
                of his last four games.Quentin Johnston(86.2%) had a bad drop 
                on a long pass. He remains inconsistent and difficult to trust 
                in lineups despite the playing time.Alex Erickson(78.5%) took over the No.3 role withJosh 
                PalmerandJalen 
                Guytonout, but saw just 1 target.TEGerald Everettwas inactive, which allowedDonald Parhamto 
                play 72.3% of the snaps. He saw 6 targets (4-57-0).Aaron Jones(20.8%) left early with a knee injury and third-stringerEmanuel Wilson(8.3%) left with a shoulder injury. That leavesAJ Dillon(72.2%) to get most of the work next week.Christian Watson(77.8%) played the most snaps of any Packers 
                receiver and finally found the endzone. However, he’s not 
                getting enough looks or consistent enough to be a fantasy WR3.The Packers are spreading the ball out to four WRs making them 
                all risky options.Romeo Doubs(68.1%),Jayden Reed(69.4%) andDontayvion Wicks(33.3%) also see action.Luke Musgrave(63.9%) andTucker Kraft(41.7%) are splitting 
                tight end duties but Musgrave remains the pass-catching option.NYG @ WASOffensive SnapsGiants: 55Commanders: 81Saquon Barkleyplayed 90.9% of the snaps for the Giants and caught 2 touchdown 
                passes.Darius Slayton(50.9%) left with an arm injury. In addition to Slayton, the Giants 
                used four other receivers:Wan'Dale 
                Robinson(67.3%),Jalin 
                Hyatt(52.7%),Sterling 
                Shepard(47.3%),Isaiah 
                Hodgins(43.6%). Slayton had the highest target share of 19.2%.TEDaniel Bellingerplayed 92.7% of the snaps but had just 3 
                targets.WithAntonio Gibsonout,Brian Robinson Jr.played 77.8% of the 
                snaps and had 26 opportunities, including 9 targets as the Commanders 
                were playing from behind in this game.Chris Rodriguez Jr.(19.8%) 
                filled the backup role and finished with a 6-43-0, 1-5-0 line.The Commanders continue to use a large WR pool which caps the 
                value ofTerry 
                McLaurin(80.2%),Jahan 
                Dotson(79.0%) andCurtis 
                Samuel(16.0% - ejected).Jamison 
                Crowder(29.6%),Dyami 
                Brown(25.9%) andByron 
                Pringle(25.9%) were also in the mix. McLaurin led the group 
                with a 16.7% target share.LV @ MIAOffensive SnapsRaiders: 61Dolphins: 70OnlyJosh Jacobs(77.0%) andAmeer Abdullah(23.0%) played at 
                running back for the Raiders.Hunter Renfrow(44.3%) andTre Tucker(39.3%) are splitting work 
                as the No.3 receiver behindDavante Adams(98.4%) andJakobi Meyers(82.0%).TEMichael Mayerplayed 80.3% of the snaps. He can be considered 
                as a streaming option.Devon Achane(4.3%) returned the to the field this week and promptly injured 
                his knee again. The injury doesn’t seem serious.Raheem Mostert(78.6%) had 22 carries whileSalvon Ahmed(28.6%) 
                worked as the No.3 running back ahead ofJeff Wilsonwho was inactive.Tyreek Hillposted a 10-146-1 line while playing just 58.6% of 
                the snaps due to a wrist issue but did come back in the game.Cedrick Wilson(64.3%) was working as the No.3 receiver behindJaylen Waddle(82.9%).Durham Smythewas inactive which allowedJulian Hill(67.1%) 
                andTyler Kroft(30.0%) to share tight end duties. The Dolphins 
                don’t use their tight ends in the passing game so we can 
                ignore them.ARI @ HOUOffensive SnapsCardinals: 61Texans: 67WithEmari Demercadoout,Tony Jones(26.2%) worked as the backup 
                RB behindJames Conner(68.9%).Michael Wilson(shoulder) was inactive.Rondale 
                Moore(72.1%) saw 1 target that went for a 48-yard TD.Greg 
                Dortchplayed 75.4% of the snaps behindMarquise 
                Brown(95.1%). Brown has 3 catches in the last two weeks. 
                Dortch led the group with a 27.6% target share.TETrey McBrideplayed every snap and continues to be an easy 
                TE1. He had a 24.1% target share.Devin Singletary(85.1%) dominated the backfield for the Texans 
                withDameon Pierceout. He handled 88% of the rushing attempts.The Texans were back to their normal three-wide receiver group 
                ofNico Collins(76.1%),Tank Dell(76.1%) andRobert Woods(74.6%). 
                Dell posted his third 100-yard receiving game of the season. Collins 
                led the group with a 28.9% target share.CHI @ DETOffensive SnapsBears: 75Lions: 62D’Onta Foreman(24.0%) left this game with an ankle injury.Khalil 
                Herbert(42.7%) andRoschon 
                Johnson(33.3%) would split time if Foreman were to miss next 
                week with Herbert being the lead running back.Equanimeous St. Brown(42.7%) andTyler Scott(36.0%) were working 
                as the third receiver behindDarnell Mooney(60.0%) andD.J. Moore(97.3%). Moore is the only reliable fantasy option.TECole Kmetplayed 78.7% of the snaps and had an 18.2% target 
                share.You kind of figuredDavid Montgomery(40.3%) was going to score 
                a TD in this game.Jahmyr Gibbs(56.5%) did most of his yardage 
                damage through the air (6-59-0).Donovan Peoples-Joneswas active but played just 3 snaps.Jameson Williams(64.5%) continued to work as the No.3 receiver.TESam LaPortaplayed 85.5% of the snaps and had a 15.6% target 
                share.PIT @ CLEOffensive SnapsSteelers: 58Browns: 75This game was predictably a low-scoring affair between a couple 
                of good defenses and the Browns startingDorian Thompson-Robinsonat QB.Jaylen Warren(44.8%) was the offensive star as he broke off 
                a 74-yard TD run.Najee Harris(56.9%) was inefficient on his 
                13 touches.Kenny Pickettisn’t good which makesGeorge Pickens(91.4%) 
                andDiontae Johnson(86.2%) risky fantasy assets.TEPat Freiermuthreturned to play 53.4% of the snaps whileDarnell 
                Washingtonplayed 46.6%.Jerome Ford(49.3%) andKareem Hunt(44.0%) were basically at 
                an even split in this game with 17 opportunities for Ford and 
                15 for Hunt.The Browns are using a tight three receiver rotation ofAmari Cooper(89.3%),Elijah Moore(70.7%) andCedric Tillman(88.0%).TEDavid Njoku(89.3%) saw a 22.4% target share, which led all 
                of the Browns pass catchers.DAL @ CAROffensive SnapsCowboys: 72Panthers: 59Tony Pollard(62.5%) returned to the endzone for the first time 
                since Week 1.Rico Dowdleplayed 29.2% of the snaps. Pollard had 
                17 opportunities.The Cowboys were in control of this game which allowed them to 
                play six WRs:CeeDee Lamb(79.2%),Brandin Cooks(72.2%),Jalen Tolbert(41.7%),Michael Gallup(34.7%),Jalen Brooks(22.2%) 
                andKaVontae Turpin(16.7%).Chuba Hubbard(49.2%) andMiles Sanders(45.8%) had a more even 
                workload share this week. Both had 12 touches.Adam Thielen(89.8%) had a whopping 42.3% target share.Jonathan Mingoplayed 94.9% of the snaps whileD.J. Charkplayed 74.6% 
                and didn’t have a target.TB @ SFOffensive SnapsBuccaneers: 7149ers: 60Rachaad White(80.3%) continues to have a strong role despite 
                the rushing stats being inefficient. He makes up for it in the 
                receiving game.Trey Palmer(71.8%) continues to impress on the field but isn’t 
                seeing enough volume behindMike Evans(78.9%) andChris Godwin(80.3%).TECade Otton(95.8%) continues to be an every-down player for 
                the Bucs.Brock Purdyposted another highly efficient performance (21 of 
                25, 333-3-0, 4-14-0).Elijah Mitchell(13.3%) continues to be the No.2 RB behindChristian McCaffrey(86.7%).Brandon Aiyuk(88.3%) saw a 24% target share which was second 
                to TEGeorge Kittle(96.7%) who saw a 36% target share.Deebo Samuel(85.0%) played his normal role but was left out the endzone.SEA @ LAROffensive SnapsSeahawks: 65Rams: 67Kenneth Walker(10.8%) left with an oblique injury and is likely 
                to miss some time. That paves the way forZach Charbonnet(84.6%) 
                to see increased work.DeeJay Dallasshould fill-in behind Charbonnet.DK Metcalf(70.8%) led the receivers with a 23.7% target share.Tyler Lockett(55.4%) was dealing with a hamstring issue and saw 
                his snaps decrease a bit.Jaxon Smith-Njigba(67.7%) had a 15.8% 
                target share.Royce Freeman(62.75) got more work thanDarrell Henderson(35.8%) 
                for the Rams but Freeman isn’t involved in the receiving 
                game. He has 1 target on the season.Cooper Kupp(26.9%) left this game with an ankle injury which 
                allowedAustin Trammell(68.7%) to see increased opportunities. 
                Trammell had a 20.7% target share.Puka Nacua(88.1%) andTutu Atwell(88.1%) were in their normal 
                roles.NYJ @ BUFOffensive SnapsJets: 57Bills: 76The Jets were never in this game.Breece Hall(63.2%) has a difficult 
                time carving out fantasy value given the poor state of this offense.Dalvin Cook(24.6%) had 2 touches whileIsrael Abanikanda(17.5%) 
                played 10 meaningless snaps.Garrett Wilson(94.7%) had 8 targets that resulted in 2 catches

                first half which limited their play total.Jalen Hurtsthrew just 
                22 passes.D’Andre Swift(64.3%) was the offensive star for the Eagles taking 15 touches

                Sneed. That resulted in Brown getting 1 catch for 8 yards 
                on 4 targets. That resulted inDeVonta 
                Smith(94.6%) seeing a 38.1% target share (6-99-0).Julio Jones(57.1%) andOlamide Zaccheaus(39.3%) are filling 
                the secondary receiver roles.WithoutDallas Goedert, the Eagles usedJack Stoll(55.4%),Grant Calcaterra(21.4%) andAlbert Okwuegbunam(17.9%) at tight end. 
                The trio combined for 2 targets.Isiah Pacheco(60.8%) saw 20 touches whileJerick McKinnon(30.4%)

                numerous drops which significantly impacted the game. Kelce looks 
                slow/injured.Justin Watson(63.3%) had a 28.2% target share which tells you 
                all you need to know about this group.Rashee Rice(57.0%),Skyy Moore(50.6%),Marquez Valdes-Scantling(46.8%),Kadarius Toney(27.8%) andMecole Hardman(20.3%) all see action. Rice is the 
                only fantasy consideration.Please enable JavaScript to view thecomments powered by Disqus.

The Bengals lostJoe Burrow(44.3%) to a wrist injury in this 
                game which obviously damaged their offensive production.Jake Browning(55.7%) completed 57.1% of his passes in relief.

Joe Mixon(63.9%) was the lone bright spot for the offense turning 
                in his second-best fantasy performance of the season (16-69-0, 
                5-31-1).

Trayveon Williamsworked as the backup RB, playing 31.1% of the 
                snaps.

Ja'Marr Chase(98.4%),Tyler 
                Boyd(90.2%) andTrenton 
                Irwin(95.1%) worked exclusively as the top three receivers.

Tanner Hudson(34.4%) saw the most targets (4) from the tight end position, 
                ahead ofIrv Smith(39.3%) who has just two targets in his last two games.

Keaton Mitchell(36.4%) played ahead ofJustice 
                Hill(25.8%) in this game, but the Ravens are still using 
                all three running backs which caps their upside… unless you’reGus Edwards(37.9%) who seemingly finds the endzone every week.

Zay Flowers(98.5%) had a long catch-and-run TD called back on 
                a bad holding call.Odell Beckham Jr.(33.3%) missed some time 
                in this game with a shoulder issue but still managed 116 yards 
                on 4 catches.

Rashod Bateman(78.8%) andNelson Agholor(40.9%) are also in 
                the mix, making it difficult to get usable production from Flowers.

TEMark Andrews(10.6%) left early with an ankle injury and will 
                miss the remainder of the season which will affect this offense 
                moving forward. More use of the WRs should be expected andIsaiah Likely(74.2%) will be a priority pickup of the waiver wire.



TEN @ JAX

Offensive SnapsTitans: 40Jaguars: 71

The extremely low play volume for Tennessee led to just 17 pass 
                attempts forWill Levisand 19 team rushing attempts.

Derrick Henry(62.5%) andTyjae Spears(45.0%) were the only 
                running backs to play.

WRChris Mooreplayed 75.0% of the snaps but saw just 1 target.

Jacksonville’s blowout led toTank 
                Bigsby(14.1%) getting some extra work along withD’Ernest 
                Johnson(23.9%). The two backups combined for 17 touches.

Calvin Ridley(80.3%) came to life with a 7-103-2 day whileZay Jonesreturned to his No.3 role playing 63.4% of the snaps.



LAC @ GB

Just 13 opportunities forAustin Ekeler(70.8%) this week (10-64-0, 
                2-6-0).Joshua Kelley(29.2%) was the only other RB to play a 
                snap.

Keenan Allen(93.8%) now has double-digit targets in three out 
                of his last four games.Quentin Johnston(86.2%) had a bad drop 
                on a long pass. He remains inconsistent and difficult to trust 
                in lineups despite the playing time.

Alex Erickson(78.5%) took over the No.3 role withJosh 
                PalmerandJalen 
                Guytonout, but saw just 1 target.

TEGerald Everettwas inactive, which allowedDonald Parhamto 
                play 72.3% of the snaps. He saw 6 targets (4-57-0).

Aaron Jones(20.8%) left early with a knee injury and third-stringerEmanuel Wilson(8.3%) left with a shoulder injury. That leavesAJ Dillon(72.2%) to get most of the work next week.

Christian Watson(77.8%) played the most snaps of any Packers 
                receiver and finally found the endzone. However, he’s not 
                getting enough looks or consistent enough to be a fantasy WR3.

The Packers are spreading the ball out to four WRs making them 
                all risky options.Romeo Doubs(68.1%),Jayden Reed(69.4%) andDontayvion Wicks(33.3%) also see action.

Luke Musgrave(63.9%) andTucker Kraft(41.7%) are splitting 
                tight end duties but Musgrave remains the pass-catching option.



NYG @ WAS

Saquon Barkleyplayed 90.9% of the snaps for the Giants and caught 2 touchdown 
                passes.

Darius Slayton(50.9%) left with an arm injury. In addition to Slayton, the Giants 
                used four other receivers:Wan'Dale 
                Robinson(67.3%),Jalin 
                Hyatt(52.7%),Sterling 
                Shepard(47.3%),Isaiah 
                Hodgins(43.6%). Slayton had the highest target share of 19.2%.

TEDaniel Bellingerplayed 92.7% of the snaps but had just 3 
                targets.

WithAntonio Gibsonout,Brian Robinson Jr.played 77.8% of the 
                snaps and had 26 opportunities, including 9 targets as the Commanders 
                were playing from behind in this game.Chris Rodriguez Jr.(19.8%) 
                filled the backup role and finished with a 6-43-0, 1-5-0 line.

The Commanders continue to use a large WR pool which caps the 
                value ofTerry 
                McLaurin(80.2%),Jahan 
                Dotson(79.0%) andCurtis 
                Samuel(16.0% - ejected).Jamison

                as the No.3 receiver behindDavante Adams(98.4%) andJakobi Meyers(82.0%).

TEMichael Mayerplayed 80.3% of the snaps. He can be considered 
                as a streaming option.

Devon Achane(4.3%) returned the to the field this week and promptly injured 
                his knee again. The injury doesn’t seem serious.

Raheem Mostert(78.6%) had 22 carries whileSalvon Ahmed(28.6%) 
                worked as the No.3 running back ahead ofJeff Wilsonwho was inactive.

                the snaps due to a wrist issue but did come back in the game.

Cedrick Wilson(64.3%) was working as the No.3 receiver behindJaylen Waddle(82.9%).

Durham Smythewas inactive which allowedJulian Hill(67.1%) 
                andTyler Kroft(30.0%) to share tight end duties. The Dolphins 
                don’t use their tight ends in the passing game so we can 
                ignore them.



ARI @ HOU

WithEmari Demercadoout,Tony Jones(26.2%) worked as the backup 
                RB behindJames Conner(68.9%).

                Dortch led the group with a 27.6% target share.

TETrey McBrideplayed every snap and continues to be an easy 
                TE1. He had a 24.1% target share.

Devin Singletary(85.1%) dominated the backfield for the Texans 
                withDameon Pierceout. He handled 88% of the rushing attempts.

The Texans were back to their normal three-wide receiver group 
                ofNico Collins(76.1%),Tank Dell(76.1%) andRobert Woods(74.6%). 
                Dell posted his third 100-yard receiving game of the season. Collins 
                led the group with a 28.9% target share.



CHI @ DET

D’Onta Foreman(24.0%) left this game with an ankle injury.Khalil 
                Herbert(42.7%) andRoschon 
                Johnson(33.3%) would split time if Foreman were to miss next 
                week with Herbert being the lead running back.

Equanimeous St. Brown(42.7%) andTyler Scott(36.0%) were working 
                as the third receiver behindDarnell Mooney(60.0%) andD.J. Moore(97.3%). Moore is the only reliable fantasy option.

TECole Kmetplayed 78.7% of the snaps and had an 18.2% target 
                share.

You kind of figuredDavid Montgomery(40.3%) was going to score 
                a TD in this game.Jahmyr Gibbs(56.5%) did most of his yardage 
                damage through the air (6-59-0).

Donovan Peoples-Joneswas active but played just 3 snaps.Jameson Williams(64.5%) continued to work as the No.3 receiver.

TESam LaPortaplayed 85.5% of the snaps and had a 15.6% target 
                share.



PIT @ CLE

This game was predictably a low-scoring affair between a couple 
                of good defenses and the Browns startingDorian Thompson-Robinsonat QB.

Jaylen Warren(44.8%) was the offensive star as he broke off 
                a 74-yard TD run.Najee Harris(56.9%) was inefficient on his 
                13 touches.

Kenny Pickettisn’t good which makesGeorge Pickens(91.4%) 
                andDiontae Johnson(86.2%) risky fantasy assets.

TEPat Freiermuthreturned to play 53.4% of the snaps whileDarnell 
                Washingtonplayed 46.6%.

Jerome Ford(49.3%) andKareem Hunt(44.0%) were basically at 
                an even split in this game with 17 opportunities for Ford and 
                15 for Hunt.

The Browns are using a tight three receiver rotation ofAmari Cooper(89.3%),Elijah Moore(70.7%) andCedric Tillman(88.0%).

TEDavid Njoku(89.3%) saw a 22.4% target share, which led all 
                of the Browns pass catchers.



DAL @ CAR

Tony Pollard(62.5%) returned to the endzone for the first time 
                since Week 1.Rico Dowdleplayed 29.2% of the snaps. Pollard had 
                17 opportunities.

The Cowboys were in control of this game which allowed them to 
                play six WRs:CeeDee Lamb(79.2%),Brandin Cooks(72.2%),Jalen Tolbert(41.7%),Michael Gallup(34.7%),Jalen Brooks(22.2%) 
                andKaVontae Turpin(16.7%).

                workload share this week. Both had 12 touches.

Adam Thielen(89.8%) had a whopping 42.3% target share.Jonathan Mingoplayed 94.9% of the snaps whileD.J. Charkplayed 74.6% 
                and didn’t have a target.



TB @ SF

Rachaad White(80.3%) continues to have a strong role despite 
                the rushing stats being inefficient. He makes up for it in the 
                receiving game.

Trey Palmer(71.8%) continues to impress on the field but isn’t 
                seeing enough volume behindMike Evans(78.9%) andChris Godwin(80.3%).

TECade Otton(95.8%) continues to be an every-down player for 
                the Bucs.

Brock Purdyposted another highly efficient performance (21 of 
                25, 333-3-0, 4-14-0).

Elijah Mitchell(13.3%) continues to be the No.2 RB behindChristian McCaffrey(86.7%).

Brandon Aiyuk(88.3%) saw a 24% target share which was second 
                to TEGeorge Kittle(96.7%) who saw a 36% target share.Deebo Samuel(85.0%) played his normal role but was left out the endzone.



SEA @ LAR

Kenneth Walker(10.8%) left with an oblique injury and is likely 
                to miss some time. That paves the way forZach Charbonnet(84.6%) 
                to see increased work.DeeJay Dallasshould fill-in behind Charbonnet.

DK Metcalf(70.8%) led the receivers with a 23.7% target share.Tyler Lockett(55.4%) was dealing with a hamstring issue and saw 
                his snaps decrease a bit.Jaxon Smith-Njigba(67.7%) had a 15.8% 
                target share.

Royce Freeman(62.75) got more work thanDarrell Henderson(35.8%) 
                for the Rams but Freeman isn’t involved in the receiving 
                game. He has 1 target on the season.

Cooper Kupp(26.9%) left this game with an ankle injury which 
                allowedAustin Trammell(68.7%) to see increased opportunities. 
                Trammell had a 20.7% target share.

Puka Nacua(88.1%) andTutu Atwell(88.1%) were in their normal 
                roles.



NYJ @ BUF

The Jets were never in this game.Breece Hall(63.2%) has a difficult 
                time carving out fantasy value given the poor state of this offense.Dalvin Cook(24.6%) had 2 touches whileIsrael Abanikanda(17.5%) 
                played 10 meaningless snaps.

Garrett Wilson(94.7%) had 8 targets that resulted in 2 catches 
                for 9 yards. WRXavier Gipsonplayed 78.9% of the snaps but isn’t 
                going to have fantasy value until the Jets demonstrate they can 
                move the ball.

Tyler Conklin(66.7%) shared tight end duties withJeremy RuckertandC.J. Uzomah(10.5%).

Buffalo gotTy Johnson(21.1%) involved this week which led to 
                a three-headed RBBC.James Cook(46.1%) had 20 touches whileLatavius Murray(31.6%) had 10.

WRKhalil Shakir(73.7%) broke loose for an 81-yard TD reception.Stefon Diggs(80.3%) still led the receivers with a 27.6% target

                bulk of the running back work for the Vikings. 20 opportunities 
                for Mattison, 14 for Chandler.

Jordan Addison(94.6%),K.J. Osborn(95.9%) andBrandon Powell(59.5%) were the three wide receivers used by the Vikings. Addison 
                led the group with a 20.7% target share.

TET.J. Hockenson(70.3%) had a 24.1% target share. The Vikings 
                also usedJosh Oliver(45.9%) this week who went 4-47-0.

The Broncos continue to use three running backs withJavonte Williams(49.1%) being the lead dog.Samaje Perine(36.4%) plays 
                mostly in passing situations whileJaleel McLaughlin(14.5%) has 
                the most contingent value if Williams were to go down.

Marvin Mimsplayed 56.4% of the snaps but is still having to 
                deal with Lil'Jordan Humphrey who played 34.5% of the snaps.Courtland Sutton(80.0%) now has 8 TDs on the season whileJerry Jeudy(70.9%) 
                has 1.

                first half which limited their play total.Jalen Hurtsthrew just 
                22 passes.

D’Andre Swift(64.3%) was the offensive star for the Eagles taking 15 touches 
                for 107 yards and a TD.Kenneth 
                Gainwell(30.4%) andBoston 
                Scott(12.5%) combined for 4 touches.

A.J. Brown(94.6%) was shadowed up by DBL'Jarius 
                Sneed. That resulted in Brown getting 1 catch for 8 yards 
                on 4 targets. That resulted inDeVonta 
                Smith(94.6%) seeing a 38.1% target share (6-99-0).

Julio Jones(57.1%) andOlamide Zaccheaus(39.3%) are filling 
                the secondary receiver roles.

WithoutDallas Goedert, the Eagles usedJack Stoll(55.4%),Grant Calcaterra(21.4%) andAlbert Okwuegbunam(17.9%) at tight end.

Isiah Pacheco(60.8%) saw 20 touches whileJerick McKinnon(30.4%)

                slow/injured.

                all you need to know about this group.Rashee Rice(57.0%),Skyy Moore(50.6%),Marquez Valdes-Scantling(46.8%),Kadarius Toney(27.8%) andMecole Hardman(20.3%) all see action. Rice is the

                andMyCole Pruitt(25.8%).

Michael Pittman Jr.(95.9%),Alec Pierce(94.5%) andJosh Downs(68.5%) remain the top three receivers in the Colts offense. Downs 
                and Pittman both saw a 32.5% target share.

CLE @ DEN

Jerome Ford(69.9%) played well ahead ofKareem Hunt(26.0%) 
                but the Browns fell behind and were forced to pass much of the 
                day.

Amari Cooper(74.0%) left this game with a rib injury.Elijah Moore(86.3%) led the wide receivers with a 23.1% target share.

TEDavid Njokualso had a 23.1% target share. He has at least 
                6 catches in his last three games.

Jaleel McLaughlin(3.0%) only had 2 touches in this game as the 
                Broncos stuck withJavonte Williams(70.1%) andSamaje Perine(26.9%). Williams finished with 21 touches but Perine got the 
                TD.

LAR @ ARI

Offensive SnapsRams: 67Cardinals: 71

Kyren Williams(61.2%) returned to action and saw 22 touches 
                (16-143-0, 6-61-2).Royce Freeman(34.3%) worked as the No.2 back 
                and got 13 carries, zero targets.

Cooper Kupp(88.1%) andPuka Nacua(80.6%) were in their normal 
                roles.Demarcus Robinsonplayed 59.7% of the snaps whileTutu Atwellplayed 35.8%. Nacua led the group with a 25.8% target share.

James Conner(42.3%) lost some playing time and opportunities 
                toMichael Carter(38.0%) who saw 8 touches.Emari Demercado(19.7%) 
                was also in the mix. Conner’s value will take a hit if this 
                usage continues.

Marquise Brown(87.3%),Rondale Moore(74.6%) andGreg Dortch(76.1%) were the top three wideouts for the Cardinals. Brown led 
                the group with a 27.3% target share. His 88 yards were the most 
                since Week 4.



BUF @ PHI

95 plays by the Bills led to 51 pass attempts byJosh Allen.James Cook(43.2%) andLatavius Murray(44.2%) played a similar 
                number of snaps.

Gabriel Davis(95.8%) busted out his mini-slump and posted a 
                6-105-1 line on 12 targets.Stefon Diggs(91.6%) saw 11 targets.Khalil Shakirplayed 80.0% of the snaps and has secured the No.3 
                receiver role.

TEDalton Kincaid(61.1%) saw just 6 targets on 51 attempts from 
                Allen.

D’Andre Swift(63.6%) had 15 touches, 11 more thanKenneth 
                Gainwell(34.8%).

The passing game in Philadelphia only has eyes forA.J. Brown(93.9%) andDeVonta Smith(98.5%). The two combined for 17 targets.



KC @ LV

The Chiefs were downJerick McKinnon,Kadarius ToneyandMecole Hardmanin this game.

Isiah Pachecoplayed 78.3% of the snaps and had 20 touches (15-55-2, 
                5-34-0).Clyde Edwards-Helaireplayed 20.0% of the snaps.

Down a couple receivers, the Chiefs usedRashee Rice(66.7%),Justin Watson(56.7%),Skyy Moore(56.7%) andMarquez Valdes-Scantling(53.3%). Rice led the group with a 31.3% target share. He’s 
                the only Chiefs wideout that is fantasy viable.

The Raiders continue to pound the ball withJosh Jacobs(75.9%). 
                He busted off a 63-yard TD run.Ameer Abdullah(20.7%) is the 
                backup.

Davante Adams(100%) andJakobi Meyers(91.4%) continue to be 
                the alpha receivers for the Raiders.

TEMichael Mayerplayed 84.5% of the snaps.



BAL @ LAC

Keaton Mitchell(46.5%) played the most snaps of any Ravens running 
                back and saw 11 touches.Gus Edwards(26.8%) andJustice Hill(28.2%) makeup the three-headed RBBC with Edwards second in line.

Rashod Bateman(80.3%) was operating as the Ravens No.2 receiver 
                behindZay Flowers(94.4%).Odell Beckham Jr.(32.4%) saw five 
                targets.

TEIsaiah Likelyplayed 73.2% of the snaps and saw a 20.0% target 
                share. If this usage keeps up, he’s a solid TE1.

The Chargers turned the ball over 4 times, leading to a loss.Austin Ekeler(80.3%) played well ahead ofJoshua Kelley(19.7%).

Another disappointing game forQuentin Johnston(43.9%) who left 
                with an injury but could’ve come back in but was held out.Jalen Guyton(80.3%) had a 12.2% target share.

Keenan Allen(98.5%) saw 16 targets for the second game in a 
                row.

Gerald Everett(63.6%) shared time withDonald Parham(42.4%). 
                Parham didn’t get a target.



CHI @ MIN

It was an ugly night for both offenses as only 1 TD was scored 
                (T.J. Hockenson).

Roschon Johnson(74.3%) was the lead back for the Bears handling 
                15 touches including 5-40-0 in the passing game.Khalil Herbert(21.4%) had 8 touches while D’Onta Foreman was inactive. 
                We’ll see how sticky Roschon’s lead back status is 
                once Foreman returns from injury.

Equanimeous St. Brown(48.6%) had a clear handle on the No.3 
                receiver role but onlyD.J. Moore(92.9%) is viable in the Bears 
                passing game. Moore had a 40.6% target share.

TECole Kmet(88.6%) had a 21.9% target share.

As expected, the Vikings split the running back work betweenAlexander Mattison(56.4%) andTy Chandler(32.7%). 12 touches 
                for Mattison, 5 for Chandler.

Jordan Addison(96.4%) saw a 33.3% target share and is the only 
                WR fantasy viable in the Vikings offense.K.J. Osborn(85.5%) 
                andBrandon Powell(65.5%) are desperation plays.

TET.J. Hockenson(80.0%) had a 20.0% target share.

                Metcalf, JSN andTyler Lockett(88.4%) played the majority of 
                the snaps.Tony Pollard(77.5%) handled 23 touches but was largely inefficient 
                in the run game averaging 3.4 yards per carry.Rico Dowdle(18.0%) 
                had 6 touches.CeeDee Lamb(92.1%) andBrandin Cooks(89.9%) are the main producers 
                in the passing game, although Cooks saw just a 10.0% target share 
                while Lamb had a dominant 42.5% target share.Jake Ferguson(74.2%) had a 20.0% target share and finished with

                backfield which saw a little more usage fromJaleel McLaughlin(15.0%) this week. Still, it’s Javonte or nobody from this 
                group.Courtland 
                Sutton(85.0%) now has 9 TDs this season on just 50 receptions 
                and is the only fantasy viable receiver on this team.Jerry

                Mims(30.0%) played behindLil'Jordan 
                Humphrey(41.7%).Dameon Pierce(38.2%) ripped off a 22-yard run early in this 
                game which allowed him to get extra carries onDevin Singletary(45.6%). Pierce out-touched Singletary 15 to 9. I don’t 
                think this usage is sticky.The Texans lost stud rookie receiverTank Dell(13.2%) to a broken 
                fibula. He will miss the remainder of the season.Nico Collins(80.9%) saw a huge 46.2% target share. ExpectRobert Woods(47.1%) 
                andNoah Brown(80.9%) to get more work to finish the season.WithDalton Schultzout,Brevin Jordanplayed 75.0% of the snaps

                andJoshua Kelley(42.6%). Ekeler had 16 touches for 27 yards.Quentin Johnstonplayed 77.0% of the snaps out of necessity behindKeenan Allen(88.5%).Jalen Guyton(62.3%) worked as the No.3 
                receiver well ahead ofDerius Davis(11.5%).TEsGerald Everett(63.9%) andDonald Parham(62.3%) were utilized 
                with the Chargers being thin at receiver. The two combined for 
                9 targets.TheBailey Zappeled Patriots were predictably inept on offense. 
                He completed 52.0% of his passes for 141 yards.Rhamondre Stevenson(26.6%) left early with an ankle injury and 
                is expected to miss a couple weeks.Ezekiel Elliott(68.8%) will 
                move into a lead back role.The Patriots mix of receivers includedDeVante Parker(85.9%),JuJu Smith-Schuster(82.2%) andTyquan Thornton(79.7%). None 
                of this group is fantasy viable. Parker had a 37.5% target share.DET @ NOOffensive SnapsLions: 58Saints: 67We saw 20 opportunities forDavid Montgomery(62.1%) and just 
                10 forJahmyr Gibbs(44.8%) as the Lions were playing from in

                all saw action at receiver for the Lions. As expected, ARSB saw 
                the highest target share (24.0%).The Lions liked the matchup the had at TE asSam LaPorta(81.0%) 
                saw a 36.0% target share.Derek Carr(62.7%) left with a concussion in this game which 
                allowedJameis Winston(13.4%) to see some action.Alvin Kamara(58.2%) got 22 opportunities and scored two rushing 
                TDs.TETaysom Hillplayed 41.8% of the snaps and saw 15 touches (13-59-1 
                running) and threw 2 passes.Chris Olave(61.2%) got off to a slow start but did finish with a 29.2% target 
                share.A.T. Perry(61.2%) andLynn

                worked as the No.2 running back.Marquise Brown(52.9%) continues to be bothered by his heel injury 
                andMichael Wilsonwas again inactive.Greg Dortch(69.1%),Rondale Moore(54.4%) andAndre Baccellia(45.6%) were the top receivers 
                but these guys are shaky fantasy plays.The Cardinals passing game is running through TETrey McBride(95.6%) who led the team with a 39.1% target share.The Steelers lost QBKenny Pickett(49.2%) to an ankle injury 
                in this game.Mitchell Trubisky(49.2%) will be under center the

                target share.Pat Freiermuth(3-29-0) played just 59.0% of the snaps just a 
                week after his 120-yard game against the Bengals.ATL @ NYJOffensive SnapsFalcons: 68Jets: 68Bijan Robinson(75.0%) operated as the lead back ahead of Cordarrelle 
                Patterson (30.9%) andTyler Allgeier(16.2%). Bijan had 21 touches.Drake London(85.3%) saw a 20.0% target share and continues to 
                be the only fantasy viable Falcons wide receiver.The Falcons trotted out four tight ends includingKyle Pitts(66.2%),Jonnu Smith(39.7%),MyCole Pruitt(29.4%) andParker Hesse(26.5%). Pitts saw a high 32.0% target share but finished 
                with just a 4-51-0 line.Trevor Siemian(33.8%) replacedTim Boyle(66.2%) as the Jets 
                look for answers to fix their broken offense.The Jets decided to give more work toDalvin Cook(26.5%) this 
                week which resulted in a 9-35-0, 1-11-0 line.Breece Hall(67.6%) 
                was inefficient on his touches finishing with a 13-16-0, 6-29-0

                full-time players as usual.Josh Downs(67.6%) took a backseat

                twice this week on five receptions.Jaylen Waddle(60.7%) saw 
                8 targets for the third-straight game. These two could’ve

                on the scoreboard.Brian Robinson Jr.(21.8%) left this game with a hamstring injury. 
                The Commanders have a bye next week.Chris Rodriguez Jr.(21.8%) 
                would see increased work if Robinson misses Week 15.Washington couldn’t get anything going in the passing game

                on 3 targets.Curtis Samuel(58.2%) continues to work as the third

                share.Ian Thomas(66.7%) andStephen Sullivan(45.8%) shared TE duties 
                but are off the fantasy radar.He’s not great, butRachaad White(87.1%) has one of the 
                best RB roles in the league.Mike Evans(82.3%) separated himself fromChris Godwin(83.9%) 
                this season despite them playing a similar number of snaps. Evans 
                had a 44.4% target share in this game and already has 10 TDs on

Jake Ferguson(74.2%) had a 20.0% target share and finished with

DEN @ HOU

Offensive SnapsBroncos: 60Texans: 68

Javonte Williams(65.0%) continues to lead the Broncos three-headed 
                backfield which saw a little more usage fromJaleel McLaughlin(15.0%) this week. Still, it’s Javonte or nobody from this 
                group.

Courtland 
                Sutton(85.0%) now has 9 TDs this season on just 50 receptions 
                and is the only fantasy viable receiver on this team.Jerry 
                Jeudy(70.0%) has 1 TD on 40 catches.Marvin 
                Mims(30.0%) played behindLil'Jordan 
                Humphrey(41.7%).

Dameon Pierce(38.2%) ripped off a 22-yard run early in this 
                game which allowed him to get extra carries onDevin Singletary(45.6%). Pierce out-touched Singletary 15 to 9. I don’t 
                think this usage is sticky.

The Texans lost stud rookie receiverTank Dell(13.2%) to a broken 
                fibula. He will miss the remainder of the season.Nico Collins(80.9%) saw a huge 46.2% target share. ExpectRobert Woods(47.1%) 
                andNoah Brown(80.9%) to get more work to finish the season.

WithDalton Schultzout,Brevin Jordanplayed 75.0% of the snaps 
                and finished with a 3-64-0 line on 4 targets.



LAC @ NE

Neither team found the endzone in this game… in fact the 
                Patriots posted a goose egg.

RB duties for the Chargers were split betweenAustin Ekeler(57.4%) 
                andJoshua Kelley(42.6%). Ekeler had 16 touches for 27 yards.

Quentin Johnstonplayed 77.0% of the snaps out of necessity behindKeenan Allen(88.5%).Jalen Guyton(62.3%) worked as the No.3 
                receiver well ahead ofDerius Davis(11.5%).

TEsGerald Everett(63.9%) andDonald Parham(62.3%) were utilized 
                with the Chargers being thin at receiver. The two combined for 
                9 targets.

TheBailey Zappeled Patriots were predictably inept on offense. 
                He completed 52.0% of his passes for 141 yards.

Rhamondre Stevenson(26.6%) left early with an ankle injury and 
                is expected to miss a couple weeks.Ezekiel Elliott(68.8%) will 
                move into a lead back role.

The Patriots mix of receivers includedDeVante Parker(85.9%),JuJu Smith-Schuster(82.2%) andTyquan Thornton(79.7%). None 
                of this group is fantasy viable. Parker had a 37.5% target share.



DET @ NO

We saw 20 opportunities forDavid Montgomery(62.1%) and just 
                10 forJahmyr Gibbs(44.8%) as the Lions were playing from in 
                front all game.

Amon-Ra St. Brown(79.3%),Josh Reynolds(75.9%),Jameson Williams(56.9%),Kalif Raymond(22.4%),Donovan Peoples-Jones(20.7%) 
                all saw action at receiver for the Lions. As expected, ARSB saw 
                the highest target share (24.0%).

The Lions liked the matchup the had at TE asSam LaPorta(81.0%) 
                saw a 36.0% target share.

Derek Carr(62.7%) left with a concussion in this game which 
                allowedJameis Winston(13.4%) to see some action.

Alvin Kamara(58.2%) got 22 opportunities and scored two rushing 
                TDs.

TETaysom Hillplayed 41.8% of the snaps and saw 15 touches (13-59-1 
                running) and threw 2 passes.

Chris Olave(61.2%) got off to a slow start but did finish with a 29.2% target 
                share.A.T. Perry(61.2%) andLynn 
                Bowden Jr.(71.6%) were the other featured receivers but only 
                saw 4 combined targets.

Juwan Johnson(56.7%),Foster Moreau(59.7%) andJimmy Grahamalso played at TE. Graham saw just 2 snaps but scored a TD.



ARI @ PIT

James Conner(76.5%) got 25 carries against his former team and 
                finished with 105 rushing yards and 2 TDs.Michael Carter(19.1%) 
                worked as the No.2 running back.

Marquise Brown(52.9%) continues to be bothered by his heel injury 
                andMichael Wilsonwas again inactive.Greg Dortch(69.1%),Rondale Moore(54.4%) andAndre Baccellia(45.6%) were the top receivers 
                but these guys are shaky fantasy plays.

The Cardinals passing game is running through TETrey McBride(95.6%) who led the team with a 39.1% target share.

The Steelers lost QBKenny Pickett(49.2%) to an ankle injury 
                in this game.Mitchell Trubisky(49.2%) will be under center the 
                next few weeks.

A lot of folks were onJaylen Warren(42.6%) in daily fantasy 
                this week butNajee Harris(59.0%) saw 18 touches compared to 
                10 for Warren.

Diontae Johnson(72.1%) found the endzone in garbage time, saving 
                his fantasy day. He andGeorge Pickens(80.3%) both had a 18.5% 
                target share.

Pat Freiermuth(3-29-0) played just 59.0% of the snaps just a 
                week after his 120-yard game against the Bengals.



ATL @ NYJ

Bijan Robinson(75.0%) operated as the lead back ahead of Cordarrelle 
                Patterson (30.9%) andTyler Allgeier(16.2%). Bijan had 21 touches.

Drake London(85.3%) saw a 20.0% target share and continues to 
                be the only fantasy viable Falcons wide receiver.

The Falcons trotted out four tight ends includingKyle Pitts(66.2%),Jonnu Smith(39.7%),MyCole Pruitt(29.4%) andParker Hesse(26.5%). Pitts saw a high 32.0% target share but finished 
                with just a 4-51-0 line.

Trevor Siemian(33.8%) replacedTim Boyle(66.2%) as the Jets 
                look for answers to fix their broken offense.

The Jets decided to give more work toDalvin Cook(26.5%) this 
                week which resulted in a 9-35-0, 1-11-0 line.Breece Hall(67.6%) 
                was inefficient on his touches finishing with a 13-16-0, 6-29-0 
                line.

Garrett Wilsonplayed every snap and finished with a 3-50-0 line.



IND @ TEN

As expected,Zack Moss(94.4%) got a big workload withJonathan Taylorout. Moss had 21 touches but was very inefficient (19-51-0, 
                2-6-0).

Michael Pittman Jr.(95.8%), andAlec Pierce(98.6%) were basically 
                full-time players as usual.Josh Downs(67.6%) took a backseat 
                to Pierce for a change but Pittman is the alpha in this offense 
                with a 39.0% target share.

Derrick Henry(40.0%) left this game with a concussion which 
                allowedTyjae Spears(67.1%) to see some increased work. 20 touches 
                for Spears in this game.

DeAndre Hopkins(76.5%),Nick Westbrook-Ikhine(82.4%) andChris Moore(69.4%) were the top receivers for the Titans.Treylon Burksreturned from injury but played just 11.8% of the snaps. Hopkins 
                had a 36.4% target share.



MIA @ WAS

Devon Achane(60.7%) saw most of his work in the 2nd half but 
                did see 20 touches finishing with a 17-73-2, 3-30-0 line.Raheem Mostert(37.7%) got most of his work in the first half and managed 
                to find the endzone again.

Tyreek Hill(50.8%) continues to be a freak of nature, scoring 
                twice this week on five receptions.Jaylen Waddle(60.7%) saw 
                8 targets for the third-straight game. These two could’ve 
                had bigger games if the Commanders would’ve pushed them 
                on the scoreboard.

Brian Robinson Jr.(21.8%) left this game with a hamstring injury. 
                The Commanders have a bye next week.Chris Rodriguez Jr.(21.8%) 
                would see increased work if Robinson misses Week 15.

Washington couldn’t get anything going in the passing game 
                this week asTerry McLaurin(81.8%) didn’t record a catch 
                on 3 targets.Curtis Samuel(58.2%) continues to work as the third 
                receiver but led the group with a 22.7% target share along withJahan Dotson(81.8%).

TELogan Thomas(61.8%) also failed to record a catch but did 
                have a 2-point conversion.



CAR @ TB

Chuba Hubbard(65.3%) had his best fantasy day of the season 
                (25-104-2) whileMiles Sanders(31.9%) had 9 touches.

Bryce Younghas less than 200 yards passing in five-straight 
                games.Adam Thielen(88.9%) andJonathan Mingo(95.8%) are the 
                starting wideouts. Mingo led the Panthers with a 38.5% target 
                share.

Ian Thomas(66.7%) andStephen Sullivan(45.8%) shared TE duties 
                but are off the fantasy radar.

He’s not great, butRachaad White(87.1%) has one of the 
                best RB roles in the league.

Mike Evans(82.3%) separated himself fromChris Godwin(83.9%) 
                this season despite them playing a similar number of snaps. Evans 
                had a 44.4% target share in this game and already has 10 TDs on 
                the season while Godwin has 2.



CLE @ LAR

Jerome Ford(50.7%) andKareem Hunt(35.2) continue to share 
                running back duties with both getting a similar number of opportunities 
                (12,13).

Amari Cooper(32.4%) left this game with a concussion.Elijah Moore(73.2%) had a 29.23% target share as a result.Cedric Tillmanplayed 93.0% of the snaps but had just six targets.

TEDavid Njoku(83.1%) had six targets but just 2 receptions 
                for 17 yards.

It was theKyren Williamsshow for the Rams as he played 93.8% 
                of the snaps and had 27 touches.Royce Freemanplayed just 4 snaps.

Puka Nacua(62.5%) left this game with a shoulder issue but later 
                returned. He’s No.1 in the WR pecking order aboveCooper Kupp(98.4%).



SF @ PHI

The best running back role in the league belongs toChristian McCaffrey(88.1%), who not only gets the volume (20 touches) but 
                has talent.Elijah MitchellandJordan Masoncombined for 8 snaps.

TheDeebo Samuel(83.1%) show made a stop in Philadelphia scoring three times and 
                racking up 138 total yards.Brandon 
                Aiyuk(86.4%) had a 28.0% target share.

Jalen Hurts(93.1%) left briefly to be checked for a concussion 
                but returned with the game already out of hand.

D’Andre Swift(41.7%) was barely used in this game (12 opportunities) as the 
                Eagles were down big. That resulted inKenneth 
                Gainwellplaying 54.2% of the snaps.

A.J. Brown(86.1%) andDeVonta Smith(100.0%) continue to soak 
                up the majority of work in the Eagles passing game. It’s 
                likely we’ll seeDallas Goedertin Week 14.



KC @ GB

Isiah Pacheco(70.1%) andClyde Edwards-Helaire(25.4%) were 
                the only two running backs to see a snap for the Chiefs asJerick McKinnonwas inactive. Pacheco (18-110-1, 3-13-0) had 21 touches.

The Chiefs WR group continues to be a mess with Mahomes lacking 
                chemistry with most of his receivers.Rashee Rice(68.7%) is the 
                only fantasy viable option.

TETravis Kelce(88.1%) had just a 16.7% target share.

WithAaron Jonesout,AJ Dillonplayed 62.5% of the snaps and 
                handled 19 touches.Patrick Taylor() worked as the No.2 RB but 
                only saw 2 touches.

Christian Watson(73.4%) led the Green Bay receiving corps with 
                a 25.7% target share. He seemed to injure his hamstring late in 
                the game so keep an eye on practice reports this week.



CIN @ JAX

For a game at least, the Bengals got great play from their backup 
                QB.Jake Browningcompleted 86.5% of his passes and ended up as 
                the QB4 on the week.

The Bengals finally got rookieChase Brown(15.1%) involved at 
                running back (9 carries, 61 yards). He only had 2 carries prior 
                to this game. He’ll be worth a pickup if you have the bench 
                space.Joe Mixon(71.2%) handled 25 touches in this overtime game 
                and posted a 19-68-2, 6-49-0 line.

Tee Higgins(78.1%) returned to action but was relatively quiet (3-36-0) considering 
                Browning threw for 354 yards.Ja’Marr 
                Chase(95.9%) was the focal point of the receiving game with 
                a 33.3% target share.Tyler 
                Boydplayed 75.3% of the snaps and threw an INT on a trick 
                play.

Another week, another QB injury.Trevor Lawrence(76.8%) left 
                with a sprained ankle. No word yet on how much time he will miss.

Travis Etienne(62.3%) handled just 15 touches (11-45-1, 4-34-0). He came into 
                the game with a chest injury.D'Ernest 
                Johnson(36.2%) had 6 touches for 9 yards.

Christian Kirk(1.4%) left this game on the first offensive play 
                with a groin injury. That didn’t helpCalvin Ridley(85.5%) 
                who finished with a 4-26-0, 3-7-0 line on 8 targets.Zay Jonesplayed 92.8% of the snaps and should benefit if Kirk misses significant 
                time.Parker Washington(59.4%) also got into the mix and saw 
                6 targets.

TEEvan Engram(84.1%) had his best fantasy day of the season 
                (9-82-1) and had a 23.1% target share.

NE @ PIT

Offensive SnapsPatriots: 57Steelers: 70Ezekiel Elliott(91.2%) had a dominant role withRhamondre Stevensonout, handling every running back carry and getting 29 touches. 
                He’s an easy RB2 with RB1 upside when he finds the endzone. 
                Upcoming schedule for Zeke: KC, @DEN, @BUF.The passing offense underBailey 
                Zappeisn’t going to be great but we saw an outlier outcome 
                (240-3-1) against the Steelers.The Patriots were three wide receivers including WRDeVante Parker,Demario DouglasandKayshon Boutte. That leftJuJu Smith-Schuster(98.2%) andTyquan Thornton(94.7%) to be every-down players.Jalen Reagor(35.1%) filled the third receiver role but only had 
                1 target. JuJu led the group with a 23.1% target share.TEHunter Henry(87.7%) had 3 targets and caught all three for 
                40 yards and 2 TDs. Happy Birthday!The Steelers offense continues to sputter regardless of the OC 
                or quarterback.Najee Harris(57.1%) andJaylen Warren(52.9%) were in their 
                normal roles despite Harris carrying the Questionable tag. Neither 
                RB was noteworthy.Diontae Johnson(68.6%) had a decent fantasy day as he found 
                the endzone and had a late catch in garbage time to help pad his 
                stats.George Pickens(85.7%) and the rest of the Steelers receivers 
                were quiet asMitchell Trubiskythrew for just 190 yards.TEPat Freiermuth(68.6%) is sharing time withDarnell Washington(42.9%) andConnor Heyward(15.7%) which caps his fantasy upside.CAR @ NOOffensive SnapsPanthers: 80Saints: 52Chuba Hubbard(77.5%) maintained his lead-back role overMiles Sanders(21.2%) and handled 25 touches as the Panthers got off

The passing offense underBailey 
                Zappeisn’t going to be great but we saw an outlier outcome 
                (240-3-1) against the Steelers.

The Patriots were three wide receivers including WRDeVante Parker,Demario DouglasandKayshon Boutte. That leftJuJu Smith-Schuster(98.2%) andTyquan Thornton(94.7%) to be every-down players.Jalen Reagor(35.1%) filled the third receiver role but only had 
                1 target. JuJu led the group with a 23.1% target share.

TEHunter Henry(87.7%) had 3 targets and caught all three for 
                40 yards and 2 TDs. Happy Birthday!

The Steelers offense continues to sputter regardless of the OC 
                or quarterback.

Najee Harris(57.1%) andJaylen Warren(52.9%) were in their 
                normal roles despite Harris carrying the Questionable tag. Neither 
                RB was noteworthy.

Diontae Johnson(68.6%) had a decent fantasy day as he found 
                the endzone and had a late catch in garbage time to help pad his 
                stats.George Pickens(85.7%) and the rest of the Steelers receivers 
                were quiet asMitchell Trubiskythrew for just 190 yards.

The Colts used four tight ends in this game:Kylen 
                Granson(37.5%),Will 
                Mallory(31.2%),Mo 
                Alie-Cox(28.1%) andAndrew 
                Ogletree(26.6%). This is a situation to avoid.

Chase Brown(30.0%) has earned a role behindJoe Mixon(63.3%). 
                Brown had 11 touches and scored on a 54-yard screen pass early 
                in the game.Trayveon Williams(1.7%) had just 1 touch andChris Evanswas inactive.

Ja'Marr Chase(86.7%) andTee 
                Higgins(75.0%) saw just 4 targets a piece as the Bengals 
                only attempted 25 passes and allowed Mixon to do the heavy lifting 
                in this game. TETanner 
                Hudson(23.3%) caught the other receiving TD.



JAX @ CLE

Trevor Lawrenceplayed every snap despite suffering a high ankle 
                sprain the week before.

Travis Etienne(77.6%) now has 4 receptions in each of his last three games but 
                is only averaging 3.7 yards per carry on the season.D'Ernest 
                Johnson(26.3%) had six opportunities as the backup RB.

WithChristian Kirkout,Calvin Ridley(94.7%),Zay Jones(84.2%) 
                andParker Washington(61.8%) were the top three wideouts for 
                the Jaguars. Jones led the group with a 28.6% target share. Ridley 
                was not far behind with a 26.5% target share.

TEEvan Engram(89.5%) was the star of the passing show, posting 
                a 11-95-2 line on 12 targets. His best two fantasy days of the 
                season have come in back-to-back weeks.

Jerome Ford(56.6%) andKareem Hunt(36.8%) both saw double-digit 
                touches with Ford posting a 12-51-0, 5-31-0 line. Hunt was able 
                to find the endzone but had just 30 total yards.

Amari Cooper(84.2%),Elijah Moore(69.7%) andCedric Tillman(60.5%) led the wideouts but it was TEDavid Njoku(81.6%) who 
                did the most damage, scoring twice and racking up 91 receiving 
                yards. Cooper had a 32.6% target share.



DET @ CHI

Jahmyr Gibbsout-snappedDavid Montgomeryin this game 41 to 
                23 as the Lions were playing from behind the entire 4th quarter. 
                However, both had a similar number of touches (14, 13).

The Lions used five receivers in this game includingAmon-Ra St. Brown(87.7%),Jameson Williams(58.5%),Josh Reynolds(55.4%),Kalif Raymond(35.4%) andDonovan Peoples-Jones(13.8%). ARSB 
                led the group with a 26.5% target share.

D'Onta Foreman(54.9%) played the most of the three Chicago RBs and handled 13 
                touches.Roschon 
                Johnson(28.2%) andKhalil 
                Herbert(16.9%) combined for just 4 touches. It appears Foreman 
                is the lead back for now.

D.J. MooreandDarnell Mooneyboth played 90% of the snaps but 
                Moore, who had a 32.3% target share, is the only wideout with 
                any fantasy value.

TECole Kmet(84.5%) had a 22.6% target share and has at least 
                7 targets in five of his last six games.



TB @ ATL

A big workload forRachaad White(83.8%) who saw 25 carries and 
                27 touches.Chase Edmonds(17.6%) mixed in for 10 touches as the 
                Bucs went run-heavy against the Falcons.

Chris Godwin(83.8%) led the Bucs with a 37.9% target share but 
                had just 5 catches for 53 yards.Mike Evans(92.6%) had just 1 
                catch for 8 yards on six targets.

It was still a three-headed committee for the Falcons at running 
                back butBijan Robinsondid play 77.8% of the snaps. He did split 
                rushing attempts almost equally (10, 9) withTyler Allgeier(20.8%).Cordarrelle Patterson(16.7%) only had three touches.

Monster day forDrake London(76.4%) who had a 28.2% target share 
                and posted a 10-172-0 line on 11 targets. This was easily his 
                best fantasy day of the season.

TEKyle Pitts(84.7%) andJonnu Smith(69.4%) both saw action 
                as usual. Jonnu had 7 targets while Pitts had 6.



HOU @ NYJ

It wasDevin Singletary(57.1%) back in the lead RB role for 
                the Texans who lostC.J. Stroudin this game with a concussion.Dameon Pierce(14.3%) handled just five touches as the score got 
                out of hand which allowedDare Ogunbowaleto play 28.6% of the 
                snaps.

Nico Collins(5.4%) left this game early with a calf injury. 
                His second calf injury of the season.Xavier Hutchinson(73.2%) 
                filled the void and should be looked at on the waiver wire if 
                Collins is out for any length of time.Robert Woods(71.4%),Noah Brown(66.1%) andJohn Metchie(50.0%) were also in the mix.

TEBrevin Jordanplayed 75.0% of the snaps withDalton Schultzinactive.

Breece Hall(61.8%) has seen 9-8-9 targets over his last three 
                games. He finished with a 10-40-0, 8-86-1 line.Dalvin Cook(23.5%) 
                had 8 touches for 8 yards.

Garrett Wilson(91.2%) had a 40.0% target share and finished 
                with a 9-108-0 line.Allen Lazardplayed 72.1% of the snaps and 
                didn’t have a target.



SEA @ SF

Kenneth Walker(55.9%) returned from an oblique injury this week 
                and had 13 opportunities compared to 10 forZach Charbonnet(42.4%). 
                This likely the backfield split we’ll see most often from 
                the Seahawks.

DK Metcalf(89.8%) was ejected late in this game.Tyler Lockett(81.4%) andJaxon Smith-Njigba(71.2%) were catching passes fromDrew Lockin this game asGeno Smith(groin) was inactive. JSN

                for 25 yards.

                his first carry 72 yards down to the 3-yard line.Jordan Mason(11.1%) punched it in from there.Elijah Mitchellwas out with 
                a knee injury.

Brandon Aiyuk(90.7%),Deebo Samuel(77.8%) and TEGeorge Kittle(92.6%) all did fantasy damage this week. Deebo and Aiyuk both 
                had a 33.3% target share. Deebo has a rushing TD in four of his 
                last five games.



MIN @ LV

Rough day for the Vikings who scored just 3 points.Joshua Dobbs(73.65) got pulled for ineffectiveness.Nick Mullens(26.4%) could 
                start Week 15 against the Bengals.

Alexander Mattison(31.9%) left with an ankle injury which allowedTy Chandler(55.6%) to handle 15 touches. Chandler should see 
                an increased role next week.Kene Nwangwuplayed 3 snaps.

As if it couldn’t get any worse,Justin Jefferson(18.1%) 
                left early with a chest, rib injury.Jordan Addison(95.8%),K.J. Osborn(70.8%) andBrandon Powell(50.0%) would be the starting 
                WRs next week if Jefferson sits.

A really rough day for the Raiders who scored just 0 points.Josh Jacobs(63.0%) left the game with a knee injury.Zamir White(9.3%) andAmeer Abdullah(27.8%) would handle the running back 
                work next week if Jacobs can’t go.

Davante Adams(98.1%) had a 34.5% target share but only averaged 
                7.6 yards per catch.Jakobi Meyers(98.1%) had a 20.7% target 
                share.

TEMichael Mayerplayed 94.4% of the snaps but had just 2 targets.



BUF @ KC

James Cook(44.2%) was a difference maker for the Bills taking 
                15 touches for 141 yards and a TD. Buffalo also worked inLatavius Murray(32.5%) andTy Johnson(20.8%). Murray and Johnson combined 
                for 11 touches.

Gabriel Davis(81.8%) had zero catches on two targets.Josh Allenfailed to look his way when Davis was wide-open for a TD.Stefon Diggs(79.2%) andKhalil Shakir(61.0%) were in their normal roles.

Dawson Knox(46.8%) returned to action but played behindDalton Kincaid(77.9%). Kincaid had a 22.2% target share while Knox had 
                an 8.3% target share.

NoIsiah Pachecothis week allowedClyde Edwards-Helaire(48.5%) 
                andJerick McKinnon(45.5%) to share running back duties. 15 opportunities 
                for CEH, 7 for McKinnon.

Another solid game fromRashee Ricewho saw his snap share expand 
                to 84.8% this week. He easily led the WR group with a 25.6% target 
                share.Justin Watson(54.5%),Kadarius Toney(43.9%),Skyy Moore(34.8%),Marquez Valdes-Scantling(33.3%) andRichie James(16.7%) 
                all saw the field but have very little fantasy value.

TETravis Kelce(89.4%) had a 25.6% target share.



DEN @ LAC

The Broncos stuck with their three-headed running back attack.Javonte Williams(59.7%) scored his first rushing TD of the season 
                and handled 20 touches.Jaleel McLaughlin(19.4%) andSamaje Perine(20.9%) saw 13 combined touches.

Another week another TD forCourtland 
                Sutton(74.6%). That’s now 10 TDs for Denver’s No.1 wideout.Jerry Jeudy(56.7%) andLil'Jordan 
                Humphrey(56.7%) played the same number of snaps.

The Chargers lost QBJustin Herbert(45.6%) to a fractured finger 
                on his throwing hand. He won’t play in Week 15.Easton Stick(54.4%), come on down.

Isaiah Spiller(17.6%) got involved (6 touches) this week as 
                the Chargers tried to spice up their running game. Nothing they 
                did affected the usage ofAustin Ekeler(72.1%) who posted a 10-51-1, 
                5-49-0 line.Joshua Kelley(10.3%) had just 3 touches.

Alex Erickson(66.2%) worked as the No.2 receiver behindKeenan Allen(95.6%) andQuentin Johnston(88.2%). Erickson had just 
                1 catch on 7 targets.Jalen Guytonplayed 32.4% of the snaps and 
                had just 1 target.

Gerald Everett(67.6%) had a 19.5% target share and played well 
                ahead ofDonald Parham(22.1%).



PHI @ DAL

A couple bad games in a row now forD’Andre 
                Swift(50.9%) who posted a 11-39-0 line with zero targets.Kenneth Gainwell(45.5%) had four touches for 28 yards.

The Eagles turned the ball over too much which limited their 
                offensive output.A.J. Brown(92.7%),DeVonta Smith(94.5%) andJalen Hurtsall fumbled. Brown had a 46.4% target share.

TEDallas Goedert(83.6%) returned to action and posted a 4-30-0 
                line which isn’t bad considering the Eagles were light on 
                play volume.

Tony Pollard(72.0%) grinded out 59 rushing yards on 16 carries 
                but did have 7-37-0 on 8 targets in the passing game.Rico Dowdle(28.0%) had 13 touches and found the endzone.

CeeDee Lamb(89.0%) had a 25.6% target share.Michael Gallup(48.8%) had a big catch that led to a 3-48-1 line.

                had a 20.5% target share. He’s in the weekly TE1 conversation.

                to handle 17 touches.Patrick Taylor(47.1%) handled just 6 touches 
                but did have 52 yards.

Christian Watsonmissed as well with a hamstring injury. As expected,Romeo Doubs(82.4%) andJayden Reed(69.1%) played the most snaps. 
                Reed led the WR group with a 26.3% target share.

TETucker Kraftplayed every snap and caught all 4 of his targets for 64 yards.

Saquon Barkley(85.7%) scored twice and handled 23 touches for 
                the Giants.

The mainly used four receivers:Darius 
                Slayton(92.9%),Wan'Dale 
                Robinson(78.6%),Jalin 
                Hyatt(64.3%),Isaiah 
                Hodgins(35.7%). Robinson led the group with a 35.0% target 
                share butTommy

Nick Westbrook-Ikhine(88.7%),DeAndre Hopkins(63.4%),Treylon Burks(64.8%), andChris Moore(43.7%) were the top receivers

                That’s back-to-back games with 12 targets.

TEChigoziem Okonkwo(67.6%) had 6 targets for the second consecutive 
                game.

Raheem Mostert(63.9%) did most of the damage for Miami in this 
                game rushing for 2 TDs. He now has 16 rushing TDs on the season.Devon Achane(45.8%) had 16 opportunities and is the preferred 
                passing game back.

Tyreek Hill(47.2%) injured his ankle early and sat out a big 
                portion this game.Jaylen Waddle(81.9%),Cedrick Wilson(55.6%) 
                andBraxton Berrios(45.8%) got some extra opportunities as a 
                result. Waddle led all the receivers with a 24.2% target share.

LV @ LAC

Offensive SnapsRaiders: 64Chargers: 65We got a laugher between the Raiders and Chargers that resulted 
                in a 63-21 win for Las Vegas and the firing of Chargers HC Brandon 
                Staley.With NoJosh 
                Jacobs(quad),Zamir 
                Whitegot the most run playing 70.3% of the snaps.Ameer 
                Abdullah(26.6%) handled backup duties andBrandon 
                Bolden(3.1%) managed to find the endzone despite playing 
                just 2 snaps. White handled 20 touches and even got 4 targets. 
                He’s a solid RB2 when Jacobs is out. Raiders are @KC and @IND 
                the next two weeks.Davante Adams(81.2%),Jakobi Meyers(87.5%) andTre Tucker(45.3%) 
                all scored for the Raiders who left Adams in long enough to get 
                him 100 yds. Adams led the group with a 23.1% target share.TEMichael Mayer(64.1%) also found the endzone on 5 targets.Being down 42-0 at halftime led to a lot of work forIsaiah Spiller(36.9%) who finished with 16 carries.Austin Ekeler(40.0%) only 
                got 9 touches with the game completely out of hand.Joshua Kelley(23.1%) is now third string.NoKeenan Allenin this game butJosh Palmer(72.3%) returned 
                and got a loose for a big play (79-yard TD) which is going to 
                look good in the fantasy box score.Quentin Johnston(92.3%) was 
                a full-time player and should continue to be so as the Chargers 
                play out the string.Alex Erickson(55.4%) andJalen Guyton(49.2%) 
                are along for the ride but aren’t fantasy worthy.TEGerald Everett(63.1%) had a 25.8% target share but only managed 
                41 yards.Donald Parhamwas inactive.MIN @ CINOffensive SnapsVikings: 68Bengals: 70The Vikings leaned onTy Chandler(80.9%) withAlexander Mattisonon the shelf. Chandler handled 26 touches whileKene Nwangwu(10.3%) 
                had just 1 carry. This is encouraging usage for Week 16 if Mattison 
                remains out.Justin Jeffersonwas on the field for 95.6% of the snaps and 
                had a 31.3% target share but it wasJordan Addison(91.2%) who 
                lit up the scoreboard with a 6-111-2 line.K.J. Osborn(54.4%) 
                filled the No.3 WR role.TET.J. Hockenson(86.8%) had a 21.9% target share.Joe Mixon(70.0%) played significantly more snaps thanChase Brown(53.8%) but only out-touched him 13 to 10. Brown is going 
                to be a viable flex option down the stretch.Ja'Marr Chase(71.4%) left this game early with a shoulder injury and will have 
                an MRI on Monday.Tee 
                Higgins(87.1%) andTyler 
                Boyd(57.1%) would become the focus of the passing game is 
                Chase misses Week 16. Higgins had a 20% target share and managed 
                to find the endzone twice while catching just half of his 8 targets.PIT @ INDOffensive SnapsSteelers: 58Colts: 67Najee Harris(34.5%) andJaylen Warren(69.0%) were the only 
                two running backs to touch the ball in the Steelers 30-13 loss 
                to the Colts. 12 touches for Najee while 15 for Warren. It’s 
                clear the Steelers prefer Warren in negative game-script.Diontae Johnson(86.2%) scored the Steelers only TD.George Pickens(93.1%) led the receivers with a 26.9% target share.Since his blow-up game in Week 12,Pat Freiermuth(75.9%) has 
                just 3 catches in each of his last three games.The Colts got hit with the injury bug in this game includingZack Moss(28.4%) who left early with an arm injury. After he 
                left,Trey Sermon(43.3%) andTyler Goodson(57.9%) split the 
                work and both were effective. The two combined for 28 carries 
                and 167 rushing yards.Michael Pittman Jr.(31.3%) was off to a hot start (4-78-0) but 
                left due to a concussion.D.J. Montgomery(62.7%) stepped in alongsideJosh Downs(58.2%) andAlec Pierce(97.0%) and saw a 14.8% target 
                share. Montgomery isn’t likely to be a fantasy option even 
                if Pittman misses Week 16.As usual, the Colts played four tight ends -Mo Alie-Cox(52.2%),Andrew Ogletree(56.7%),Kylen Granson(29.9%),Will Mallory(11.9%) 
                - making them unreliable for fantasy lineups.DEN @ DETOffensive SnapsBroncos: 64Lions: 66The Broncos couldn’t get anything going on the ground against 
                the Lions.Javonte Williams(48.4%),Samaje Perine(39.1%) andJaleel McLaughlin(12.5%) were in their typical roles. Williams 
                led the group with 14 touches.Jerry Jeudy(62.5%) made a 40-yard catch and led the team with 
                7 targets.Courtland Sutton(93.8%) finished with a 5-71-0 line.The Lions beatdown of the Broncos included a huge game fromJahmyr Gibbs(48.5%) whileDavid Montgomery(51.5%) pitched with 17 carries 
                for 85 yards. Gibbs exploded for a 11-100-1 rushing and 2-8-1 
                receiving.The passing game flowed throughAmon-Ra 
                St. Brown(92.4%) and TESam 
                LaPorta(95.5%). LaPorta scored 3 times. ARSB had a 28.1% 
                target share and posted a 7-112-1 line.Jameson 
                Williams(68.2%) had a 21.9% target share and finished 4-47-0. 
                We’ve yet to see a breakout game from him but two games against

                just 2 snaps. White handled 20 touches and even got 4 targets. 
                He’s a solid RB2 when Jacobs is out. Raiders are @KC and @IND 
                the next two weeks.

Davante Adams(81.2%),Jakobi Meyers(87.5%) andTre Tucker(45.3%) 
                all scored for the Raiders who left Adams in long enough to get 
                him 100 yds. Adams led the group with a 23.1% target share.

TEMichael Mayer(64.1%) also found the endzone on 5 targets.

Being down 42-0 at halftime led to a lot of work forIsaiah Spiller(36.9%) who finished with 16 carries.Austin Ekeler(40.0%) only 
                got 9 touches with the game completely out of hand.Joshua Kelley(23.1%) is now third string.

NoKeenan Allenin this game butJosh Palmer(72.3%) returned

                look good in the fantasy box score.Quentin Johnston(92.3%) was 
                a full-time player and should continue to be so as the Chargers 
                play out the string.Alex Erickson(55.4%) andJalen Guyton(49.2%) 
                are along for the ride but aren’t fantasy worthy.

The Vikings leaned onTy Chandler(80.9%) withAlexander Mattisonon the shelf. Chandler handled 26 touches whileKene Nwangwu(10.3%) 
                had just 1 carry. This is encouraging usage for Week 16 if Mattison 
                remains out.

Justin Jeffersonwas on the field for 95.6% of the snaps and 
                had a 31.3% target share but it wasJordan Addison(91.2%) who 
                lit up the scoreboard with a 6-111-2 line.K.J. Osborn(54.4%) 
                filled the No.3 WR role.

TET.J. Hockenson(86.8%) had a 21.9% target share.

Joe Mixon(70.0%) played significantly more snaps thanChase Brown(53.8%) but only out-touched him 13 to 10. Brown is going 
                to be a viable flex option down the stretch.

Ja'Marr Chase(71.4%) left this game early with a shoulder injury and will have 
                an MRI on Monday.Tee 
                Higgins(87.1%) andTyler 
                Boyd(57.1%) would become the focus of the passing game is 
                Chase misses Week 16. Higgins had a 20% target share and managed 
                to find the endzone twice while catching just half of his 8 targets.



PIT @ IND

Najee Harris(34.5%) andJaylen Warren(69.0%) were the only 
                two running backs to touch the ball in the Steelers 30-13 loss 
                to the Colts. 12 touches for Najee while 15 for Warren. It’s 
                clear the Steelers prefer Warren in negative game-script.

Diontae Johnson(86.2%) scored the Steelers only TD.George Pickens(93.1%) led the receivers with a 26.9% target share.

Since his blow-up game in Week 12,Pat Freiermuth(75.9%) has 
                just 3 catches in each of his last three games.

The Colts got hit with the injury bug in this game includingZack Moss(28.4%) who left early with an arm injury. After he 
                left,Trey Sermon(43.3%) andTyler Goodson(57.9%) split the 
                work and both were effective. The two combined for 28 carries 
                and 167 rushing yards.

Michael Pittman Jr.(31.3%) was off to a hot start (4-78-0) but 
                left due to a concussion.D.J. Montgomery(62.7%) stepped in alongsideJosh Downs(58.2%) andAlec Pierce(97.0%) and saw a 14.8% target 
                share. Montgomery isn’t likely to be a fantasy option even 
                if Pittman misses Week 16.

As usual, the Colts played four tight ends -Mo Alie-Cox(52.2%),Andrew Ogletree(56.7%),Kylen Granson(29.9%),Will Mallory(11.9%) 
                - making them unreliable for fantasy lineups.



DEN @ DET

The Broncos couldn’t get anything going on the ground against 
                the Lions.Javonte Williams(48.4%),Samaje Perine(39.1%) andJaleel McLaughlin(12.5%) were in their typical roles. Williams 
                led the group with 14 touches.

Jerry Jeudy(62.5%) made a 40-yard catch and led the team with 
                7 targets.Courtland Sutton(93.8%) finished with a 5-71-0 line.

The Lions beatdown of the Broncos included a huge game fromJahmyr Gibbs(48.5%) whileDavid Montgomery(51.5%) pitched with 17 carries 
                for 85 yards. Gibbs exploded for a 11-100-1 rushing and 2-8-1 
                receiving.

The passing game flowed throughAmon-Ra 
                St. Brown(92.4%) and TESam 
                LaPorta(95.5%). LaPorta scored 3 times. ARSB had a 28.1% 
                target share and posted a 7-112-1 line.Jameson 
                Williams(68.2%) had a 21.9% target share and finished 4-47-0. 
                We’ve yet to see a breakout game from him but two games against 
                Minnesota and sandwiched around a game against Dallas offers opportunity.



KC @ NE

With Pacheco out, the Chiefs stuck withClyde Edwards-Helaire(61.5%) andJerick McKinnon(33.8%) as their running backs. McKinnon 
                got a TD pass in a trick play around the goaline. 17 touches for 
                CEH in a positive game-script for the Chiefs.

Rashee Rice(92.3%) has emerged in recent weeks as the only WR 
                in the Chiefs offense we can trust.Marquez Valdes-Scantling(33.8%),Justin Watson(67.7%),Kadarius Toney(40.0%) can be ignored.

TETravis Kelce(76.9%) hurt is elbow in this game. The guy has 
                been banged up most of the season and looks old out there.

The Patriots allowedKevin Harris(13.2%) to get some playing 
                time at RB this week and he found the endzone. This is stillEzekiel Elliott’s (86.8%) “show” however.

                Douglas both had a 16.1% target share.

TEHunter Henry(71.7%) was the focus of the passing gameplan. 
                He led all Patriots receivers with a 23.7% target share.



NYJ @ MIA

The Jets got shutout in a dismal display of offense.Breece Hall(39.7%) only had 8 opportunities.Dalvin Cook(17.2%) andIsrael Abanikanda(37.9%) also saw action.

Garrett Wilson(94.8%),Allen Lazard(89.7%) andXavier Gipson(69.0%) were the top three receivers for the Jets. Wilson had 
                just 4 targets.

Raheem Mostert(54.1%) is now up to an incredible 20 total TDs 
                on the season after two more in Week 15. He’s been a league-winner.Devon Achane(39.3%) had 12 touches.

The fantasy playoffs were a bad time forTyreek Hill(ankle) 
                decided to miss.Jaylen Waddle(67.2%) took a shot to the chest 
                early in the game but continued to play and led the team with 
                a 34.6% target share.Cedrick Wilson(77.0%) got extra playing 
                time with Hill out as didBraxton Berrios(39.3%) andChosen Anderson(37.7%).



CHI @ CLE

                Foreman(26.0%) andKhalil 
                Herbert(23.3%) were still in the mix. Roschon had just 11 
                opportunities. Foreman had 6 carries for -6 yards. This isn’t 
                a backfield we can count on.

D.J. Moore(87.7%) andDarnell Mooney(83.3%) both had a 22.9% 
                target share.Tyler Scott(50.7%) worked as the third receiver.

                line.



HOU @ TEN

Dameon Pierce(5.2%) played only 4 snaps and worked behindDare Ogunbowale(19.5%). Safe to say he won’t have any fantasy 
                value unlessDevin Singletary(75.3%) gets injured. Singletary 
                handled 30 touches in the absence of QBC.J. Stroud(concussion).

                just 8 snaps.

Dalton Schultz(84.4%) was back in his normal starting role whileBrevin Jordan(24.7%) played sparingly.

A rough day forDerrick Henry(54.0%) who has dominated the Texans 
                in the past. He posted 16 carries for 9 yards and 0 TDs. Yikes.Tyjae Spears(52.4%) had 10 opportunities.

DeAndre Hopkins(77.8%),Treylon Burks(76.2%), andChris Moore(60.3%) were top three wideouts for the Titans.Nick Westbrook-Ikhine(47.6%) was also in the mix. Hopkins had a 34.6% target share 
                and is the only fantasy viable option.

TEChigoziem Okonkwo(63.5%) had just 3 targets.



NYG @ NO

Just 11 touches forSaquon Barkley(50.0%) this week as the Giants 
                failed to reach the endzone.Matt Breida(38.7%) had 6 opportunities.

Darius Slayton(95.2%),Wan'Dale 
                Robinson(85.5%),Jalin

                to just 41.9% of the snaps. He had 6 targets.

                andMarquez Callaway(21.0%). Bowden led the group with an 18.5% 
                target share.

                8 touches in the rain against Carolina.Tyler Allgeier(50.0%) 
                had 15 touches and the Falcons lost.Cordarrelle Patterson(26.9%) 
                got the lone TD of the game.

                finished with a 21-89-0, 2-50-1 line.

                had 6 targets with a 4-57-1 line.

Aaron Jones(48.3%) returned to action but ended up splitting 
                time withPatrick Taylor(43.3%). Jones handled 17 touches while 
                Taylor had just 3.AJ Dillon(thumb) was inactive.

                a toe injury.Romeo Doubs(90.0%) andDontayvion Wicks(78.3%) 
                continue to work the most with Reed.

TETucker Kraft(95.0%) finished with a 4-57-1 line on 6 targets.



SF @ ARI

A three-touchdown game forChristian McCaffrey(76.8%) who I 
                didn’t have enough of this season. He has 20 TDs on the 
                season.Jordan Mason(23.2%) worked as the No.2 RB withElijah Mitchellout.

Deebo Samuel(84.7%) continues to produce on low volume (7 targets, 
                1 rush).Brandon Aiyuk(82.1%) and TEGeorge Kittle(84.7%) took 
                a back seat this week on the 49ers’ offense this week. They 
                combined for 9 targets.

A solid outing fromJames Conner(48.6%) this week despite the 
                low play volume.Michael CarterandEmari Demercadoboth played 
                24.3% of the snaps.

The Cardinals have a weak WR group asMarquise Brown(32.4%) 
                continues to try and play through his heel injury. He left early 
                in this one and could be on the shelf moving forward.Michael Wilsonreturned to play 87.8% of the snaps but had just 3 targets 
                and 0 receptions.Greg Dortch(64.9%) andRondale Moore(63.5%) 
                are afterthoughts.

The star of the Arizona passing game continues to be TETrey McBride(71.6%) who saw a 28.9% target share. He has at least 
                9 targets in four out of his last five games.



WAS @ LAR

Sam Howell(73.3%) got benched in this game but is expected to 
                start Week 16.

WithBrian Robinson Jr.out, the Commanders usedAntonio Gibson(45.0%) andChris Rodriguez Jr.(33.3%). Rodriguez had 10 touches 
                (all carries) while Gibson had 9 touches that included 5 receptions. 
                This will be a split backfield as long as Robinson remains out.

Terry McLaurin(85.0%) had his best fantasy day of the season (6-141-1) on a 
                35.3% target share.Curtis 
                Samuel(71.7%) had a 26.5% target share whileJahan 
                Dotsonhad just 1 target.

TELogan Thomas(80.0%) has just 7 receiving yards in his last 
                two games.

Kyren Williams(77.3%) remains the workhorse for the Rams despite 
                two fumbles. He had 34 opportunities in this game!Royce Freeman(22.7%) had six carries for 16 yards.

Cooper KuppandPuka Nacuaboth played every snap.Demarcus Robinson(94.7%) was the clear No.3 wideout butTutu Atwellis expected 
                to return in Week 16.



DAL @ BUF

Tony Pollard(71.9%) andRico Dowdle(26.3%) were in their normal 
                roles. 13 touches for Pollard.

CeeDee Lamb(100.0%) got a rushing TD late in the game and led 
                the WRs with a 31.3% target share. This was the only Dallas TD 
                of the game.

The Cowboys got stomped by the Bills running game and specificallyJames Cook(55.9%) who handled 27 touches on his way to a 25-179-1, 
                2-42-1 line.Latavius Murray(20.6%) andTy Johnson(29.4%) were 
                also in the mix.

Stefon Diggs(45.6%),Gabriel Davis(72.1%),Khalil Shakir(48.5%) 
                and the rest of the Bills’ passing game wasn’t needed 
                asJosh Allenonly threw the ball 15 times.



BAL @ JAX

Keaton Mitchell(35.7%) went down with a knee injury and will 
                miss the remainder of the season. Expect a usage bump forGus Edwards(40.0%) as he should take more of the early-down work.Justice Hill(25.7%) had six touches in this game and will also 
                see increased opportunities moving forward.

Zay Flowers(84.3%) continues to see a lot of playing time but 
                is very inconsistent with his production. He had just 2 targets 
                in this game.Odell Beckham Jr.(54.3%) andRashod Bateman(44.3%) 
                are difficult to trust in this low volume passing attack.

Isaiah Likely(74.3%) continues to be a solid low-end TE1 option. 
                He had a 26.1% target share.

Too many turnovers for the Jaguars limited their offensive output.Trevor Lawrenceis in the concussion protocol.

Travis Etienne(69.4%) had 16 opportunities but just 59 yards. 
                He’s a middling RB2 these days.

Calvin Ridley(91.9%) led the Jaguars receivers with a 28.6% 
                target share whileZay Jones(61.3%) injured his hamstring late 
                in the game.

TEEvan Engram(83.9%) had just a 14.3% target share leading to a 4-28-0 line.



PHI @ SEA

The Eagles offense looked lethargic… perhaps due to Hurts’ 
                sickness or something else.

As usual,D’Andre 
                Swift(59.4%) andKenneth 
                Gainwell(40.6%) handled all of the running back duties for 
                the Eagles. The TV broadcast seemed to indicate the coaching staff 
                was looking to get Gainwell going but that never really materialized. 
                Swift handled 20 touches for 75 yards. He hasn’t scored since 
                Week 11.

WR snaps continue to be dominated byA.J. Brown(95.7%) andDeVonta Smith(95.7%). Brown had a 33.3% target share.Quez Watkins(52.2%) 
                andJulio Jones(31.9%) are situational players.

TEDallas Goedert(84.1%) had a 30.0% target share but caught 
                just 4 passes for 30 yards on 9 targets.

Kenneth Walker(55.7%) dominated touches in this game 22 to 4 
                overZach Charbonnet(44.3%). Walker has cracked 100 rushing yards 
                just once this season.

It took a while, butDK Metcalf(91.8%) finally got going in 
                the second half (5-78-0).Tyler Lockett(75.4%) led the receivers 
                with a 28.1% target share but caught just 3 passes for 21 yards.Jaxon Smith-Njigba(68.9%) caught the game-winning TD late in 
                the fourth quarter.

Seattle continues to use three tight ends:Noah Fant(62.3%),Will Dissly(39.3%) andColby Parkinson(34.4%). Fant can be considered 
                in a pinch but this is largely a situation to avoid.
